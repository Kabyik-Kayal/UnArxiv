    "in order to extend the spectral action principle to non - compact spaces , we propose a framework for spectral triples where the algebra may be non - unital but the resolvent of the dirac operator remains compact . \n we show that an example is given by the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator which , interestingly , provides two different dirac operators . \n this leads to two different representations of the volume form in the hilbert space , and only their product is the grading operator . \n the index of the even - to - odd part of each of these dirac operators is @xmath0 . \n we also compute the spectral action for the corresponding connes - lott two - point model . \n there is an additional harmonic oscillator potential for the higgs field , whereas the yang - mills part is unchanged . \n the total higgs potential shows a two - phase structure with smooth transition between them : in the spontaneously broken phase below a critical radius , all fields are massive , with the higgs field mass slightly smaller than the ncg prediction . in the unbroken phase above the critical radius , gauge fields and fermions are massless , \n whereas the higgs field remains massive .",

    "the acoustic sound dispersion of nitrogen in its liquid and supercritical phases has been studied by inelastic x - ray scattering . \n approaching supercritical conditions , the gradual disappearance of the positive sound dispersion , characteristic of the low temperature liquid , is observed . in the supercritical state , \n evidence for a crossover between adiabatic and isothermal sound propagation regimes is inferred by an analysis of the dynamic structure factor based on generalized hydrodynamics . \n the development of inelastic x - ray scattering ( @xmath0 ) @xcite has opened up new opportunities in the study of the high - frequency dynamics of liquids at nanometer distances and picosecond timescales . \n various @xmath1 investigations unveiled that , in the proper thermodynamical conditions , @xmath2 relaxation processes occur in the thz frequency range . \n these processes manifest themselves by an upward bending of the sound dispersion relation , which deviate from the low - frequency linear behavior dictated by the adiabatic sound velocity . \n accordingly , the sound velocity increases from the adiabatic value , @xmath3 , to the `` infinite '' frequency value , @xmath4 @xcite . \n if @xmath5 is the frequency of the probed acoustic excitation with wave vector @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the characteristic relaxation time of the structural relaxation process , the system exhibits a liquid - like ( @xmath8 ) behavior if the condition @xmath9 is fulfilled : in this limit the dispersion relation is @xmath10 . in the opposite limit , the @xmath11 one , where @xmath12 , structural rearrangements are too slow to efficiently dissipate the energy of the acoustic waves : in this limit @xmath13 . a schematic picture of this @xmath14 variation of the sound velocity form @xmath15 is shown in fig . \n 1a ( full thick line ) , where the cross -

over frequency given by @xmath25 . in this case , for @xmath26 the thermal diffusion is much slower than the period of acoustic waves , which therefore propagate adiabatically , i.e. without any thermal exchange with the local environment . in the opposite limit , @xmath27 , the thermalization of the acoustic wave is instantaneous , and the effective propagation mechanism becomes isothermal with sound velocity @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the specific heat ratio ) . \n one therefore expects to observe a transition between the adiabatic and the isothermal regimes when @xmath30 . \n this case is schematically presented in figure 1b , where linear lines represent the adiabatic ( full line ) and isothermal ( dotted line ) sound dispersion , and the dash - dot - dot line indicates the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath31 . \n contrary to the visco - elastic transition , which has been experimentally documented in many liquids @xcite , no firm evidence of the adiabatic to isothermal transition is available . \n this is mainly due to the following reasons : i ) the amplitude of the dispersive effect between @xmath32 and @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath34 which , in most liquids , is close to zero . \n ii ) the effect is often completely masked by the competing visco - elastic transition . \n iii ) the crossover occurs typically at large @xmath6 , often above the position of the first sharp diffraction peak ( fsdp ) of the static structure factor , @xmath35 . here \n , however , the finite-@xmath6 generalization of the isothermal sound speed @xmath36 - which is proportional to @xmath37 - @xcite , becomes too small to be reliably extracted from the measured @xmath38 spectra . \n these obstacles to the observation of the adiabatic to isothermal sound propagation transition can be reduced close to supercritical conditions for the following reasons : i ) the competing positive dispersion induced by the viscoelastic transition is expected to be much weaker . \n ii ) the crossover condition for the viscoelastic transition is expected to move at higher @xmath6 , i.e. higher frequency , since the structural rearrangements occur on shorter time scales . \n iii ) moreover , the intensity of the fsdp is much weaker , and consequently @xmath39 does not display any longer a pronounced minimum in the vicinity of the fsdp . \n iv ) finally , the sound speed decreases on approaching the critical point , and therefore the transition will move towards smaller @xmath6 values . \n this scenario is schematically pictured in figure 1c , where the combined effects of the structural and thermal relaxation processes are model within the framework of the molecular hydrodynamics @xcite . \n the values of @xmath7 and @xmath40 are chosen such that the transition is actually determined by the thermal relaxation process , as indicated by the arrow . \n this letter , guided by the above considerations , reports an ixs study of liquid and supercritical nitrogen . \n nitrogen has been chosen because the two thermodynamic regimes ( liquid and supercritical ) can be easily obtained within an experimentally accessible pressure and temperature range , and because of its favorable inelastic scattering cross section . \n figure 2 shows the portion of the explored thermodynamic plane . \n the inset reports the expected q -

integrated scattering , corrected for the known nitrogen form factor , @xmath68 @xcite , as well as for all geometrical artifacts . in order to put @xmath35 on an absolute scale \n , we have normalized the measured intensity to fulfill the compressibility constraint in the @xmath69 limit . \n finally , the apparent sound velocity of acoustic excitations , @xmath70 , has been determined using the relation @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the frequency value of the maximum of the longitudinal current spectra , @xmath73 . \n selected ixs spectra and their best fits are shown in fig.3 . \n each spectrum typically covers an energy transfer range of @xmath74 mev and was collected in the 2 to 14 @xmath75 @xmath6 range . \n the logarithmic plot emphasizes the overall good agreement between experimental and model line shapes , even in the tails of the spectra . \n the comparisons between the apparent dispersion relation , @xmath72 @xmath76 @xmath6 ( open circles ) , and both isothermal ( dotted line ) and adiabatic ( full line ) ones , are shown in fig . 4 at the four different temperatures 87 , 128 , 171 , and 191 k. in the same figure we also report the infinite frequency dispersion relation ( full dots ) and the inverse of the structural relaxation time @xmath77 ( dashed - dot line ) as derived from the best fit result . \n the inverse of the thermal relaxation time , @xmath22 , is also reported as derived from the nitrogen eos ( dash - dot - dot line ) . \n the results of fig.4a , corresponding to the lowest investigated temperature ( 87 k ) , show that the apparent dispersion is systematically higher than the adiabatic one . \n although the @xmath4-limit is not completely reached , in this thermodynamic point the high frequency dynamics of the liquid is mostly influenced by the structural relaxation process . \n this influence is considerably weaker at @xmath78 k ( panel b ) due to the higher value of @xmath77 which prevents even - more to reach the viscoelastic crossover conditions . on further increase of the temperature \n ( panel c and d ) , @xmath77 moves definitely out of the probed frequency range and any hint of positive dispersion on the sound velocity disappears . \n in fact , with increasing temperature the apparent dispersion relation initially approaches the adiabatic sound dispersion , but at the highest temperature is observed to go below the adiabatic dispersion and to approach the isothermal one : this is the onset of the expected transition between adiabatic and isothermal regimes . \n this effect is most clearly seen for the three highest @xmath6 points between @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath75 . \n measurements , as discussed in the text ; the open circles indicate the maxima of longitudinal current spectra . \n the dash - dotted and dash - double dotted lines represent @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively ; the former has been evaluated interpolating the results of the performed lineshape analysis , which allowed also to extract the values of infinite - frequency sound dispersion , reported as full circles._,width=283 ]    the arrows in figure 4 ( panels c and d ) indicate the @xmath6 points where one would expect the adiabatic - isothermal transition ( @xmath83 , left arrows ) and where the transition actually occurs ( right arrows ) : a @xmath6 value definitively higher than the one estimated by the left arrow . \n this difference between expected and observed transition @xmath6 points is an indication of the @xmath6-dependence of the parameter @xmath23 , which we neglected so far . \n this behavior is in agreement with the expectations suggested by numerical simulations of various molecular liquids @xcite pointing to a monotonic decrease of @xmath84 with increasing @xmath6 . as a consequence \n , the position of the crossover is shifted towards higher momentum transfers . \n even though the transition to the isothermal regime is not fully completed , its occurrence is inferred from this systematic trend . \n furthermore , it is worthwhile recalling that the present results have been obtained without imposing any constraint on the line shape fitting parameters . \n moreover , the values of the isothermal sound dispersions have been determined independently through the measured @xmath35 .    in conclusion our observations \n can be summarized as follows : i ) the apparent sound branch of nitrogen show clear signatures of a positive sound dispersion in the liquid phase , thus witnessing the presence of a structural relaxation process . \n ii ) the positive sound dispersion gradually disappears while reaching supercritical conditions , most likely due to the shift of @xmath77 above the @xmath72 values . \n iii ) at the highest investigated temperatures , the transition from the adiabatic to the isothermal sound propagation is observed . \n these findings indicate that , in the liquid phase , the high frequency dynamic of a simple , non - associated fluid , such as nitrogen , is mainly ruled by the structural relaxation , as manifested by the positive sound dispersion . \n in contrast , in the supercritical phase , the role of the structural relaxation becomes negligible and the most evident dispersive effect is the bending down of the apparent dispersion , from its adiabatic value to the isothermal one . in this regime \n , the thermal relaxation process rules the high frequency dynamics .",

    "in this paper we investigate the formation of uranus and neptune , according to the core - nucleated accretion model , considering formation locations ranging from 12 to 30 au from the sun , and with various disk solid - surface densities and core accretion rates . \n it is shown that in order to form uranus - like and neptune - like planets in terms of final mass _ and _ solid - to - gas ratio , very specific conditions are required . \n we also show that when recently proposed high solid accretion rates are assumed , along with solid surface densities about 10 times those in the minimum - mass solar nebula , the challenge in forming uranus and neptune at large radial distances is no longer the formation timescale , but is rather finding agreement with the final mass and composition of these planets . \n in fact , these conditions are more likely to lead to gas - giant planets . \n scattering of planetesimals by the forming planetary core is found to be an important effect at the larger distances . \n our study emphasizes how ( even slightly ) different conditions in the protoplanetary disk and the birth environment of the planetary embryos can lead to the formation of very different planets in terms of final masses and compositions ( solid - to - gas ratios ) , which naturally explains the large diversity of intermediate - mass exoplanets .",

    "* for many decades , the magnetic field induced changes in the conductivity of metals were the subject of intense interest not only for their own sake , but also as a valuable tool for determining their fermi surface geometry @xcite . here , \n we report a hitherto unobserved magnetoresistive effect in ultra - clean layered metals . \n we detect a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance that is capable of overcoming their very pronounced orbital magnetoresistance . \n we show that this effect is correlated with the inter - layer coupling , and disappears for fields applied along the so - called yamaji angles where the inter - layer coupling vanishes . \n therefore , this effect seems to be intrinsically associated with the existence of fermi points in the field - induced , quasi - one - dimensional electronic dispersion . \n we suggest that this effect results from the axial anomaly among fermi points . in its original formulation \n the anomaly leads to the violation of separate number conservation laws for left- and right - handed chiral , or weyl - fermions . for a certain class of gapless semiconductors , \n it was predicted to induce a large suppression of the electrical resistivity , as observed here . \n the observation of this effect in pdcoo@xmath0 , ptcoo@xmath0 and sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 suggests that it would be generic to clean metals ( or semi - metals ) near the quantum limit . * \n the magneto - conductivity or -resistivity of metals under a uniform magnetic field @xmath2 is highly dependent on the precise shape of their fermi surface ( fs ) and on the orientation of the current flow relative to the external field . \n this is particularly true for high purity metals at low temperatures whose carriers may execute many cyclotronic orbits in between scattering events . \n however , the description of the magnetoconductivity of real systems in terms of the boltzmann equation including the lorentz force , the electronic dispersion , and realistic scattering potentials is an incredibly daunting task , whose approximate solutions can only be obtained through over simplifications . despite the inherent difficulty in describing the magnetoresistivity of metallic or semi - metallic systems , it continues to be a subject of intense interest . \n indeed , in recent years , a number of new magnetoresistance phenomena have been uncovered . \n for example , although semi - classical transport theory predicts a magnetoresistivity @xmath3 , certain compounds such as @xmath4-ag@xmath0te display a linear , non - saturating magnetoresistivity@xcite which is ascribed to thequantum magnetoresistive \" scenario@xcite , associated with linearly dispersing dirac - like bands @xcite . however , in semi - metals characterized by a bulk dirac dispersion and extremely high electron mobilities such as cd@xmath5as@xmath0 , the linear magnetoresistivity develops a weak @xmath6 term as the quality of the sample increases@xcite . \n its enormous magnetoresistivity is claimed to result from the suppression of a certain protection against backscattering channels @xcite . \n the semi - metal wte@xmath0 was also found to display a  titanic \" and non - saturating magnetoresistivity which is @xmath7 under fields up to 60 t. this behavior ascribed to a nearly perfect compensation between the densities of electrons and holes @xcite . \n recently , a series of compounds were proposed to be weyl semimetal candidates characterized by a linear touching between the valence and the conduction bands at several points ( weyl points ) of their brillouin zone @xcite . \n these weyl points are predicted to lead to a pronounced negative magnetoresistivity for electric fields aligned along a magnetic field due to the so - called adler - abel - jackiw axial anomaly @xcite .    here \n , we unveil the observation of yet a novel magnetoresistive effect , namely a pronounced _ negative _ magnetoresistivity in extremely clean and non - magnetic layered metals . \n we study the langasites ptcoo@xmath0 and pdcoo@xmath0 which are characterized by a single fs sheet and as cd@xmath5as@xmath0 can display residual resistivities on the order of a just few tenths of n@xmath8 cm . given its extreme low level of disorder , for specific field orientations along which the inter - layer coupling vanishes \n , pdcoo@xmath0 can display a very pronounced positive magnetoresistivity which exceeds 550000% for @xmath9 t and for currents along the inter - layer axis . \n nevertheless , as soon as the field is rotated away from these specific orientations and as the field increases , this large orbital effect is overwhelmed by the emergence of a pronounced negative magnetoresistivity . for fields along the inter - layer direction , \n a strong longitudinal negative magnetoresistivity ( lnmr ) is observed from @xmath10 t to fields all the way up to @xmath11 t. very similar behavior is observed in the ptcoo@xmath0 compound . for the correlated sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 \n the lnmr - effect is also observable but only in the cleanest samples , i.e. , those displaying the highest superconducting transition temperatures . \n we suggest that this new effect might result from the axial anomaly between fermi points in a field - induced , quasi - one - dimensional electronic dispersion . as shown in the fig . 1**a * * pdcoo@xmath0 crystallizes in the space group @xmath12 , which results from the stacking of monatomic triangular layers  @xcite . \n the synthesis of pdcoo@xmath0 single crystals is described in the methods section . according to band structure calculations  @xcite \n , the fermi level @xmath13 is placed between the filled @xmath14 and the empty @xmath15 levels with the pd triangular planes dominating the conductivity , and leading to its highly anisotropic transport properties . \n the reported room temperature in - plane resistivity @xmath16 is just @xmath17 @xmath18 cm , making pdcoo@xmath0 perhaps the most conductive oxide known to date@xcite . \n figs . \n 1**b * * and 1**c * * show the configuration of contacts used for measuring the longitudinal magnetoresistivity of all compounds . \n de haas van alphen ( dhva ) measurements  @xcite reveal a single , corrugated and nearly two - dimensional fermi surface ( fs ) with a rounded hexagonal cross - section , in broad agreement with both band structure calculations @xcite and angle resolved photoemission measurements  @xcite . \n dhva yields an average fermi wave - vector @xmath19 m@xmath20 or an average fermi velocity @xmath21 m / s ( where @xmath22 is the carrier effective mass  @xcite in units of free electron mass ) . \n recent measurements of inter - planar magnetoresistivity @xmath23 reveal an enormous enhancement for fields along the [ 1@xmath240]-direction , i.e. , increasing by @xmath25 % at 2 k under @xmath26 t , which does not follow the characteristic @xmath3 dependence at higher fields  @xcite . \n this behavior can be reproduced qualitatively by semi - classical calculations , assuming a very small scattering rate  @xcite . \n most single - crystals display in - plane residual resistivities @xmath27 ranging from only @xmath28 up to @xmath29 n@xmath8 cm , which correspond to transport lifetimes @xmath30 ranging from @xmath31 down to @xmath32 ps ( @xmath33 is the electron charge and @xmath34 m@xmath35 @xcite ) or mean free paths @xmath36 ranging from @xmath37 up to 20 @xmath38 m  @xcite . \n however , according to ref . \n the quasiparticle life - time @xmath39 extracted from the dingle temperature becomes ( in units of length ) @xmath40 @xmath38 m . \n hence , the transport life time is larger than the quasiparticle life time by at least one order of magnitude , which is the hallmark of a predominant forward scattering mechanism , see ref . . \n for a magnetic field along @xmath41 axis , @xmath42 when @xmath43 t , in contrast @xmath44 when @xmath45 t. these estimations suggest the importance of the landau quantization for understanding our observations over a wide range of fields up to @xmath46 t.    as shown in figure 2**a * * , the low-@xmath47 magnetoresistivity or @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the zero - field inter - planar resistivity , decreases ( up to @xmath50 % ) in a magnetic field of 30 t oriented parallel to the applied current . \n given that pdcoo@xmath0 is non - magnetic and extremely clean ( see methods ) , this effect can not be attributed to magnetic impurities . in addition , given the magnitude of the effect it can not be explained in terms of the suppression of weak localization  @xcite . to support both statements , in fig . 2**b * * we show @xmath51 for a pdcoo@xmath0 single - crystal as a function of @xmath2 applied along the @xmath52 $ ] planar - direction and for several temperatures @xmath47 . in sharp contrast to results shown in fig . 2**a * * , as @xmath47 decreases @xmath53 increases considerably , by more than 3 orders of magnitude when @xmath54 k , thus confirming the absence of scattering by magnetic impurities or any role for weak localization . \n notice also that @xmath55 at low fields , which indicates that the inter - layer transport is _ coherent _ at low fields@xcite . \n figure 2**c * * depicts a simple kohler plot of the magnetoresistivity shown in * b * , where the field has also been normalized by @xmath56 , which indicates unambiguously , that the transverse magnetoresistive effect in pdcoo@xmath0 is exclusively orbital in character and is dominated by the scattering from impurities / imperfections and phonons@xcite . \n the evolution of this effect with temperature is depicted in figure 3**a**. @xmath57 is seen to decrease by a factor surpassing 60 % for fields approaching 9 t and for all temperatures below 30 k. figure 3**b * * displays @xmath58 as a function of the angle @xmath59 between @xmath2 and the _ c_-axis at a temperature @xmath60 k , for a third single - crystal . for @xmath61 the pronounced positive magnetoresistance observed at low fields , due to a classical orbital magnetoresistive effect , \n is overpowered at higher fields by the mechanism responsible for the negative magnetoresistivity . \n this behavior is no longer observed within this field range when @xmath59 is increased beyond @xmath62 . \n figure 3**c * * shows a kohler plot , i.e. @xmath63 as a function of @xmath2 normalized by @xmath49 . as seen in fig . 3**c \n * * , all curves collapse on a single curve indicating that a particular transport mechanism dominates even at high temperatures where phonon scattering is expected to be strong . \n the red line is a simple linear fit , indicating that @xmath64 at lower fields . \n supplementary figure s1 shows the longitudinal magnetoresistance @xmath65}(h)/\\rho_0 $ ] for fields and currents along the @xmath52$]-axis . \n in contrast to @xmath63 , but similarly to the longitudinal magnetoresistivity of ultra - clean elemental metals @xcite , @xmath65}(h)/\\rho_0 $ ] is observed to increase and saturate as a function of @xmath2 . \n figure 4**a * * shows @xmath57 as a function of the angle @xmath59 between the field and the _ c_-axis , for three different field values : 8 , 25 and 30 t. @xmath66 displays the characteristic structure displayed by quasi - two - dimensional metals , namely a series of sharp peaks at specific angles @xmath67 called yamaji angles ( where @xmath68 is an integer , @xmath41 is the inter - planar distance , and @xmath69 is the projection of the fermi wave number on the conduction plane ) , for which _ all _ cyclotronic orbits on the fs have an _ identical _ orbital area  @xcite . in other words , \n the corrugation of the fs no longer leads to a distribution of cross - sectional areas , as if the corrugation has been effectively suppressed . \n as discussed below , in terms of the energy spectrum , this means that the landau levels become non - dispersive at the yamaji angles  @xcite , hence one no longer has fermi points . \n the sharp peak at @xmath70 is attributed to coherent electron transport along small closed orbits on the sides of a corrugated cylindrical fermi surface@xcite . \n the width of this peak @xmath71 , shown in fig . 4**b * * for several temperatures , allows us to estimate the interlayer transfer integral @xmath72@xcite , @xmath73 assuming a simple sinusoidal fermi surface corrugation along the @xmath74-direction . here \n , the inter - planar separation is @xmath75 , since there are three conducting pd planes per unit cell , each providing one conducting hole and therefore leading to 3 carriers per unit cell . \n this value is consistent with our hall - effect measurements ( not included here ) . \n the full width at half maximum of the peak at @xmath76 is @xmath77 and @xmath13 is given by @xmath78 ev , therefore one obtains @xmath79 mev or @xmath80 . \n figure 4**c * * displays @xmath57 as a function of @xmath2 for two angles ; the yamaji angle @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively . as seen , @xmath83 for fields along @xmath84 displays a very pronounced positive magnetoresistance , i.e. @xmath85 increases by @xmath86 % when @xmath2 is swept from 0 to 35 t. but at @xmath87 t @xmath85 decreases by one order of magnitude as @xmath2 is rotated by just @xmath88 with respect @xmath84 . furthermore , as seen in fig . 4**d * * , at higher fields @xmath57 displays a crossover from a very pronounced and positive to a negative magnetoresistance , resulting from a small increment in @xmath59 relative to @xmath84 . \n this is a very clear indication for two competing mechanisms , with negative magnetoresistivity overcoming the orbital - effect when the orbitally - averaged inter - layer group velocity ( or the transfer integral @xmath72 ) becomes finite at @xmath89 . \n we emphasize that for a conventional and very clean metal , composed of a single fermi surface sheet , the magnetoresistivity should either be @xmath7 @xcite or saturate as seen in quasi - two - dimensional metals close to the yamaji angle@xcite . \n this is illustrated by the supplementary fig . \n s2 which contrasts our experimental observations with predictions based on semi - classical transport models which correctly describe the magnetoresistance of layered organic metals in the vicinity of the yamaji angle . \n @xmath57 also displays shubnikov de haas oscillations at small ( and strongly @xmath59-dependent ) frequencies which were not previously detected in ref . . \n as discussed in ref . \n these slow oscillations , observed only in the interlayer magnetoresistance of layered metals , originate from the warping of the fs . in the supplementary fig . \n s3 , we show how these frequencies disappear when the group velocity vanishes at @xmath90 . \n significantly , this novel effect does not appear to be confined to pdcoo@xmath0 . \n figure 5 presents an overall evaluation of the longitudinal magnetoresistance of isostructural ptcoo@xmath0 , while supplementary fig . \n s4 displays the observation of impurity dependent negative magnetoresistivity in the correlated perovskite sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . as shown in fig . \n 5**a * * , ptcoo@xmath0 presents a pronounced negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity either for @xmath91 _ c_-axis or for @xmath2 close to an yamaji angle . \n it also presents a very pronounced and non - saturating magnetoresistivy for fields applied along the yamaji angle . for both systems the magnetoresistivity does not follow a single power law as a function of @xmath2 . in fact , as shown in the supplementary fig . \n s4 , at @xmath90 the magnetoresistivity of the ( pt , pd)coo@xmath0 system follows a @xmath6 dependence for @xmath92 t. at intermediate fields @xmath93 deviates from the quadratic dependence , recovering it again at subsequently higher @xmath2s . \n since kohler s rule implies that @xmath94 , we argue that the observed increase in slope would imply a field - dependent reduction in scattering by impurities ( see supplementary fig . \n s5 and related discussion ) . \n the precise origin of this suppression in scattering remains to be identified . \n nevertheless , the enormous and positive magnetoresistivity observed for fields along @xmath90 seems consistent with a simple scenario , i.e. , a extremely clean system(s ) whose impurity scattering weakens with increasing magnetic field . in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , the negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity \n is observed only in the cleanest samples and for angles within @xmath95 away from the _ c_-axis . \n this compound is characterized by three corrugated cylindrical fermi surface sheets , each leading to a distinct set of yamaji - angles , making it impossible to completely suppress the inter - planar coupling at specific yamaji angle(s ) . \n negative magnetoresistivity is a common feature of ferromagnetic metals near their curie temperature , or of samples having dimensions comparable to their electronic mean free path where the winding up of the electronic orbits under a magnetic field reduces the scattering from the surface . \n it can also result from the field - induced suppression of weak localization or from the field - induced suppression of spin - scattering / quantum - fluctuations as seen in _ \n f_-electron compounds@xcite . \n none of these compounds , are near a magnetic instability , contain significant amounts of magnetic impurities or disorder making them prone to weak localization . \n the magnitude of this anomalous magnetoresistivity , coupled to its peculiar angular dependence , are in fact enough evidence against any of these conventional mechanisms . \n below , we discuss an alternative scenario based on the so - called axial anomaly which in our opinion explains most of our observations . \n the axial anomaly is a fundamental concept of relativistic quantum field theory , which describes the violation of separate number conservation laws of left and right handed massless chiral fermions in odd spatial dimensions due to quantum mechanical effects  @xcite . \n in particular , when three dimensional massless dirac or weyl fermions are placed under parallel electric and magnetic fields , the number difference between the left and the right handed fermions is expected to vary with time according to the adler - bell - jackiw formula  @xcite @xmath96 here , @xmath97 are the number operators for the right and the left handed weyl fermions , with the electric and the magnetic field strengths respectively given by @xmath98 and @xmath99 . \n the dirac fermion describes the linear touching of two - fold kramers degenerate conduction and valence bands at isolated momentum points in the brillouin zone . \n the axial anomaly was initially proposed to produce a large , negative longitudinal magnetoresistance , for a class of gapless semiconductors , for which the low energy band structure is described by massless weyl fermions @xcite . \n the reason for the negative magnetoresistance is relatively straighforward . \n assume that in very clean system the impurity scattering potential can be described by a smoothly decaying function @xmath100 which peaks at @xmath101 ( e.g. gaussian ) hence producing scattering at low angles . \n once an external @xmath2 is applied , the system would require backscattering at the larger momentum transfer @xmath102 which connects both weyl - points in _ k_-space in order to equilibrate the field - induced net number imbalance among right and left handed fermions produced by the anomaly . \n given the functional form of @xmath100 , backscattering at @xmath102 will be considerably weaker than backscattering at @xmath101 . therefore , the role of the anomaly is to suppress backscattering causing a net decrease in the resistivity under an applied magnetic field . \n recent theoretical proposals for weyl semimetals  @xcite have revived the interest in the experimental confirmation of the axial anomaly through efforts in detecting negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity  @xcite . \n there are examples of three dimensional dirac semimetals  @xcite , which may be converted , through zeeman splitting , into a weyl semimetal . \n examples include bi@xmath103sb@xmath104 at the band inversion transition point between topologically trivial and nontrivial insulators @xcite , and cd@xmath5as@xmath0  @xcite .    in analogy with the predictions for the axial anomaly between weyl points \n , here we suggest that our observations might be consistent with the emergence of the axial anomaly among the _ fermi _ points of a field - induced , one - dimensional electronic dispersion @xcite . in effect , in the presence of a strong magnetic field , the quantization of cyclotron motion leads to discrete landau levels with one dimensional dispersion and a degeneracy factor @xmath105 , see figs . \n 6**a , b , * * and * c*. consider the low energy description of a one dimensional electron gas , in terms of the right- and left - handed fermions obtained in the vicinity of the two fermi points . in the presence of an external electric field \n @xmath98 , the separate number conservation of these chiral fermions is violated according to @xmath106where @xmath97 respectively correspond to the number operators of the right- and left - handed fermions  @xcite . \n each partially occupied landau level leads to a set of fermi points , and the axial anomaly for such a level can be obtained from eq . \n [ eq2 ] , after multiplying by @xmath105 . \n therefore each level has an axial anomaly determined by eq . \n [ eq1 ] . \n when _ only one _ landau level is partially filled , we have the remarkable universal result for the axial anomaly described by adler - bell - jackiw formula of eq .  [ eq1 ] . for \n a non - relativistic electron gas this would occur at the quantum limit . \n in contrast , this situation would naturally occur for dirac / weyl semimetals , when the fermi level lies at zero energy . \n figure 6**b * * describes the situation for a quasi - two dimensional electronic system upon approaching the quantum limit , or when the inter - planar coupling becomes considerably smaller than the inter landau level separation ( e.g. in the vicinity of the yamaji angle ) . \n therefore , we conclude that the axial anomaly should be present in every three dimensional conducting system , upon approaching the quantum limit . \n explicit calculations indicate that the axial anomaly would only cause negative magnetoresistance for predominant forward scattering produced by ionic impurities  @xcite . as our experimental results show , pdcoo@xmath0 is a metal of extremely high conductivity thus necessarily dominated by small angle scattering processes and therefore satisfying the forward scattering criterion . in this metal \n the landau levels disperse periodically as shown in figs . 6**b * * and 6**c * * , depending on the relative strength of the cyclotron energy @xmath107 with respect to the inter - layer transfer integral @xmath72 . \n the condition @xmath108 is satisfied when @xmath2 roughly exceeds 100 t. for this reason fig . 6**c * * , with multiple partially occupied landau levels , describes pdcoo@xmath0 for fields along the _ c_-axis or for arbitrary angles away from the yamaji ones . \n nevertheless , one can suppress the fermi points by aligning the field along an yamaji angle , and this should suppress the associated axial anomaly . as experimentally seen , the suppression of the fermi points suppresses the negative magnetoresistivity indicating that the axial anomaly might be responsible for it . \n in summary , in very clean layered metals we have uncovered a very clear correlation between the existence of fermi points in a one - dimensional dispersion and the observation of an anomalous negative magnetoresistivity . \n the suppression of these points leads to the disappearance of this effect . \n this indicates that the axial anomaly , and related negative magnetoresistivity , would not be contingent upon the existence of an underlying three dimensional dirac / weyl dispersion . \n instead , our study in pdcoo@xmath0 , ptcoo@xmath0 and sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , which are clean metals with no dirac / weyl dispersion at zero magnetic field , indicates that the axial anomaly and its effects could be a generic feature of metal(s ) near the quantum limit . \n nevertheless , the detection of _ negative _ magnetoresistivity would depend on the underlying scattering mechanisms , i.e. observable only in those compounds which are clean enough to be dominated by elastic forward scattering caused by ionic impurities  @xcite . in a generic metal with a high carrier density , it is currently impossible to reach the quantum limit ; for the available field strength many landau levels would be populated , thus producing a myriad of fermi points . in this \n regard , extremely pure layered metals such as ( pd , pt)coo@xmath0 are unique , since by just tilting the magnetic - field in the vicinity of the yamaji angle , one can achieve the condition of a single , partially filled landau level as it would happen at the quantum limit . \n therefore , the observation in all three compounds , of a pronounced negative magnetoresistivity for fields and currents precisely aligned along the _ c_-axis is quite puzzling . \n this situation necessarily leads to the population of a multitude of fermi levels and , although it does not necessarily preclude a role for the axial anomaly , it does involve scattering among a number of fermi points at distinct landau levels . \n in such a situation the role of the anomaly is less clear . here , \n we limit ourselves at exposing the novelty and the apparent universality of our observations hoping to stimulate further theoretical developments .",

reversed reaction @xmath7 , for which more precise data are available @xcite .    as seen in fig . \n [ fig : nnbar ] , the combined data indicate that @xmath8 when @xmath9 gev . \n averaging over the available data on both the direct and time - reversed reactions , which are very consistent , and ignoring any possible variation with energy , we find : @xmath10 in other words , _ close to the @xmath11 threshold , the timelike form factor of the proton is somewhat smaller than that of the neutron ! _    the fact that this ratio is less than unity requires confirmation , but even equal cross sections for @xmath12 and @xmath13 would be quite surprising , in view of the the conventional perturbative picture of baryon - antibaryon production in @xmath0 annihilation , as shown in fig . \n [ ee - fig ] . \n we recall that the ratio of the cross sections for the corresponding @xmath14-channel processes @xmath15 should be infinite at zero momentum transfer , where the form factor simply measures the total proton and neutron charges , corresponding to a coherent sum over the electromagnetic charges of their constituent quarks . \n it is also believed that the ratio ( [ exptalratio ] ) should be large at high momentum transfers . in a naive perturbative description of @xmath0 annihilation into baryons , the virtual time - like \n photon first makes a ` primary ' @xmath16 pair , which is then dressed by two additional quark - antiquark pairs that pop out of the vacuum . \n this dressing is thought to be a perturbative qcd process at high momentum transfers , which does not distinguish between the @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks , since gluon couplings are flavor - blind . \n thus , in this conventional perturbative picture , the only difference between the production rates of proton and neutron is through the different electric charges of the primary @xmath16 pairs . \n the total perturbative cross section is obtained by superposing the amplitudes with different primary @xmath16 pairs and squaring the result : @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the amplitude at @xmath21 for making the baryon @xmath22 with a given primary flavor @xmath23 , which is determined by the baryon wave functions . \n since the wave functions of the baryon octet have a mixed symmetry , the amplitudes @xmath20 tend to be highly asymmetric in specific models . \n for example , in the chernyak - zhitnitsky proton wave function  @xcite , the @xmath17 quark dominates , i.e. , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and similarly @xmath26 , @xmath27 . \n in such a limiting case we have @xmath28 while this is an extreme case , on general grounds we expect that the @xmath17 contribution dominates in the proton and the @xmath18 in the neutron , so that @xmath29 at large momentum transfers . \n we find it puzzling that the experimental ratio ( [ exptalratio ] ) is apparently below unity when @xmath30  gev@xmath31 , whereas the ratio should be much larger than unity at both larger ( timelike ) and smaller ( spacelike ) momentum transfers . clearly , the mechanism at work here is qualitatively different from those responsible for the above intuition . \n the lack of a conventional theoretical explanation is part of the motivation for the proposed new asymmetrical @xmath32 high - statistics collider at slac for the regime @xmath33 gev @xcite . \n this machine will yield high - precision data on baryon production in @xmath32 annihilation at threshold , providing a check on the fenice data and an accurate benchmark for testing possible theoretical explanations . \n the first thing one must realize is that even though @xmath34 , the process is highly nonperturbative . \n this is because the ` extra ' kinetic energy available to the quarks is very small . \n our approach @xcite to this puzzle is based on thinking about the time - reversed processes : @xmath35 . \n these may be viewed as two - step processes , with a coherent meson state serving as an intermediate state , as shown schematically in fig . \n [ pions1-fig ] . \n one possible motivation for this picture might be provided by the skyrme model  @xcite , according to which baryons appear as solitons in a purely bosonic chiral lagrangian . \n this model is formally justified as a low - energy approximation to large-@xmath36 qcd  @xcite , and is known to provide a good description of many low - energy properties of baryons : see  @xcite for reviews . \n skyrmion - anti - skyrmion annihilation provides  @xcite-@xcite a fairly accurate description of low - energy baryon - antibaryon annihilation . just after the skyrmion and anti - skyrmion touch \n , they ` unravel ' each other , and a coherent classical pion wave emerges as a burst that takes away energy and baryon number as quickly as causality permits . \n a specific parametrization of the initial pion configuration is  @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the profile of the chiral field , @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 is a range parameter , @xmath41 is chosen so that the total energy is that of the @xmath11 pair , and the form of @xmath38 guarantees that the pion configuration has zero net baryon number . \n this crude model has been shown  @xcite to reproduce satisfactorily the inclusive single - pion spectrum in @xmath42 annihilation at rest and the branching ratios for multi - pion final states . \n the details of this specific configuration are unimportant for our purposes : what is important is that the data are not inconsistent with such a model . \n indeed , although the skyrme model provides some motivation for our approach , it is not even essential for our purpose . \n what is important is that _ a single intermediate state should dominate _ the two - step @xmath35 process . \n this could , for example , equally well be a single intermediate @xmath43 resonant meson state .    to be more precise , \n since @xmath11 annihilation is a strong - interaction process , one must consider separately the @xmath44 and @xmath45 channels . \n accurately stated , our key assumption is that both of these channels are dominated by single states . \n these might be some excited @xmath46 and @xmath47 mesons , for example , just as well as coherent pion configurations ( [ amado ] ) with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    with this picture in mind \n , we write the @xmath48 @xmath35 annihilation amplitudes as @xmath49 , where the overall phase is irrelevant , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are relatively real , and @xmath52 is the relative phase between the @xmath44 and @xmath45 amplitudes . \n we then have @xmath53 it is apparent from ( [ ratio ] ) that @xmath54 if either @xmath55 or _ \n vice versa_.    remarkably , _ there is evidence from both @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilations that @xmath57 final states dominate by large factors_.    the clearest evidence comes from @xmath58 , where it is found by measuring final states with even and odd numbers of pions respectively that @xmath59 as seen in fig .  [ \n fig : pions ] .. the cross section in fig . \n [ fig : pions ] corresponds to the final state @xmath60 ; for the total @xmath61 one should multiply it by 1.5 @xcite . \n ] at these energies , we expect most final states created by @xmath62 to contain @xmath63 pairs , so that ( [ eeratio ] ) corresponds to the non-@xmath64 initial states we expect to dominate in @xmath11 annihilation \n . the value ( [ eeratio ] ) is similar to that found at lower energies , where @xmath65 , in agreement with naive quark models . \n the fact that the ratio @xmath66 continues to be large at higher energies is consistent with ideas of generalized vector meson dominance . \n the data from @xmath67 annihilations are less clear . \n theoretically , there are various calculations and other suggestions that the cross sections for @xmath67 annihilations into @xmath44 and @xmath45 may be similar . experimentally , several initial states contribute , including @xmath68s@xmath69 , @xmath70s / d@xmath71 and various p waves , but we are interested only in the @xmath43 @xmath70s / d@xmath71 initial states . \n it is in principle possible to distinguish different initial states by comparing annihilations in gas and liquid , as has been done in the analysis of ozi - violating final states , but we are unaware of a comparable analysis of multi - pion final states . because the initial state is a mixture with different @xmath72 , it is not possible to separate @xmath44 from @xmath45 simply by counting pions , as was the case in @xmath56 annihilation . \n the most convincing experimental information known to us comes from an analysis of @xmath73 . by comparing the rates for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , it has been possible to extract  @xcite @xmath76 which is comparable to the corresponding ratio ( [ eeratio ] ) in @xmath77 annihilation \n the fact that @xmath44 dominates over @xmath45 in the ratio ( [ nnbarratio ] ) is consistent with the hypothesis that most of the @xmath78 final states are created by @xmath79 and @xmath80 pairs in the initial @xmath67 state , with a @xmath64 pair popping out of the vacuum . \n the ratio ( [ nnbarratio ] ) would be small if primary @xmath64 pairs dominated . \n we now use the experimental information on the dominance by the @xmath44 channel in both @xmath56 ( [ eeratio ] ) and @xmath70s / d@xmath71 annihilation ( [ nnbarratio ] ) in a quantitative analysis of the @xmath81 production @xmath82 ratio ( [ ratio ] ) . defining @xmath83 , \n we can rewrite ( [ ratio ] ) as @xmath84 it is clear that the zero - momentum - transfer limit @xmath85 is obtained in the limit @xmath86 , and that the high - momentum - transfer limit @xmath87 is obtained in the limit @xmath88 . in order to estimate @xmath89 , our assumption of dominance in each isospin channel by a single state ( either a coherent multi - pion state ( [ amado ] ) or a generalized vector meson @xmath90 ) tells us that @xmath91 inserting the experimental indications ( [ eeratio],[nnbarratio ] ) into ( [ factorization ] ) , we estimate that @xmath92 the top end of this range seems to us quite conservative , whereas the lower end surely requires more justification from @xmath11 annihilation data . in the following numerical analysis \n , we keep @xmath93 general , but focus extra attention on the limits @xmath94 and @xmath95 . \n it is apparent from ( [ newratio ] ) that @xmath96 is possible for any value of @xmath93 , for a restricted range of the relative phase @xmath97 . \n however , the allowed range of @xmath52 is extended if @xmath93 is small . \n it is easy to see that @xmath82 lies in a narrow range @xmath98 around unity if @xmath52 falls within the following range : @xmath99 it is apparent that @xmath96 for all values of @xmath52 if @xmath93 is small , as suggested ( [ epsilon ] ) by the available data on @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilation . \n the quantitative behaviour of @xmath82 as a function of @xmath100 and @xmath101 is shown in fig . \n [ fig : threed ] . displayed explicitly is the region of the @xmath102 plane where @xmath82 falls within the experimental range ( [ exptalratio ] ) . \n we see that this range favours @xmath103 , whatever the value of @xmath93 . \n fig . \n [ fig : twod ] displays projections of fig . \n [ fig : threed ] for the two limiting values @xmath94 and @xmath95 . the allowed range ( [ exptalratio ] ) of @xmath82 and the corresponding ranges of @xmath52 \n are also shown . \n we conclude that the _ a priori _ puzzling large experimental value of the ratio @xmath104 can be understood qualitatively . \n this is relatively easy if the @xmath105 amplitude dominates over the @xmath45 amplitude , as suggested by the available data on @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilation and our assumption of dominance by a single coherent state in each isospin channel . \n the specific range ( [ exptalratio ] ) can be understood quantitatively if the @xmath44 and @xmath45 amplitude have a large relative phase @xmath52 . \n we are not in a position to judge the plausibility of such a large value of @xmath52 , from either an experimental or a theoretical point of view . \n it would be interesting to make tests of this possibility . \n the disagreement between the naive theoretical prediction and experiment is striking again . \n we comment finally on the surprisingly large value of the ratio @xmath106 observed by the cleo collaboration @xcite ( see also @xcite-@xcite for related experimental work ) .    as shown in fig . \n [ cleo - gg - fig ] , cleo find that close to threshold , which seems analogous to fenice result for the @xmath107 ratio .    as illustrated by fig . \n [ gg - fig ] , for a given quark flavor , the perturbative amplitude for baryon - antibaryon production in the photon - photon reaction scales like the quark charge squared , compared with the linear dependence of the amplitudes on the quark charge in the @xmath0 case discussed earlier . \n thus one might naively expect the ratio @xmath108 to be even smaller than the corresponding perturbative prediction for @xmath109 in @xmath0 \n .    it would be interesting to approach this puzzle from a point of view similar to that adopted in this paper . \n however , the situation in @xmath110 collisions is more complicated , because of the wider range of possible spin and isospin states . also , the information available on the isospin and spin decomposition is sparse compared with that in @xmath0 annihilation , which we used above . \n data for @xmath111 close to threshold might cast light on the @xmath112 puzzle , but are not yet available .    in ref . \n @xcite we have proposed a simple model that is able to accommodate the surprisingly large observed value of the ratio @xmath113 . \n our suggestion is based on a simple two - step approach , in which a single intermediate state with @xmath44 dominates over @xmath45 . \n this dominant intermediate state could be motivated by a skyrmion - anti - skyrmion picture , or could be some excited @xmath46 resonance . \n our model could be tested by further measurements of the ratios of different isospin amplitudes in @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilation , and suggests a relatively large phase difference between @xmath44 and @xmath45 amplitudes . \n we look forward to more experimental data bearing on these issues , for example from a new low -

( [ eq : mnpola ] ) can be used for evaluating the time ratio @xmath53 and the actual temperature @xmath43 in the region of illumination . using the experimental value @xmath54 \n we obtain @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( for @xmath57  t ) . \n this corresponds to @xmath58  k , i.e. the real temperature under illumination is increased by 2 k. the same value for @xmath43 follows from the magnetic field dependence of @xmath59 when fitted with a brillouin function , see fig . \n [ fig : sfrspectra](c ) . \n electron spin - flip scattering with mn@xmath0 ions should also manifest itself in the dynamics of the average electron spin . indeed , since the mn polarization will be transferred back into the electron spin - system , the average electron spin should contain information about the mn polarization . in absence of other relaxation channels the dynamics of electron polarization is given by an expression similar to the @xmath40-term in eq . \n ( [ eq : ratemnpola ] ) @xmath60,\\ ] ] since it reflects the conservation of total spin in the flip - flop process . \n the electron spin relaxation time @xmath61 depends on the mn@xmath0 concentration @xmath62 and time @xmath40 through @xmath63 . for small photoelectron concentrations @xmath64 \n the electron spin relaxation time is much shorter than that of manganese , i.e. @xmath65 ( a similar relation holds for the electron - nuclear system ) . from trpl @xmath66  ns and , therefore \n , one can estimate @xmath67s for @xmath68  @xmath3 , and @xmath69  @xmath3 . under pulsed photoexcitation with repetition period @xmath70 ( which satisfies the condition @xmath71 ) , \n the manganese spin polarization is gradually accumulated and shows no change within time @xmath70 . \n therefore , in weak magnetic fields ( @xmath72 ) the solution of eq . \n ( [ eq : rateelectrpola ] ) in a time domain @xmath70 can be written as @xmath73 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_s}\\right).\\ ] ] at the moment of pulsed excitation @xmath74 the maximum possible electron polarization @xmath75 is generated @xcite . \n subsequently it decays with a characteristic time @xmath61 until it reaches the plateau , which corresponds to the steady state non - equilibrium manganese polarization . \n the plateau results from the spin back flow from manganese to the electrons , providing a long - lived electron spin memory . \n in previous trpl measurements in weak longitudinal magnetic fields we already observed a slow spin relaxation dynamics ( up to @xmath76s ) of electrons localized on shallow donors in gaas : mn @xcite . \n however , the small signal - to - noise ratio in these studies did not allow us to draw an unambiguous conclusion on the non - exponential spin evolution . \n large power densities induce undesired local heating . \n therefore , we increased the setup sensitivity by enlarging the illumination area by a factor of 400 , while keeping the pulse energy density low at @xmath77  nj/@xmath38 . \n the intensity transient of the donor - acceptor ( @xmath78 ) pl line is shown in fig .  [ \n fig : tprlplateau](a ) , showing a decay with 100  ns lifetime . \n the decay of circular polarization degree @xmath79 gives direct access to the spin dynamics of the oriented electrons . \n figure  [ fig : tprlplateau](b ) shows a nontrivial electron spin dynamics @xcite . \n we find an initial electron spin @xmath80 , which is close to the maximum value of 0.5 . \n after decay within several tens of ns the electron spin polarization reaches a plateau , whose level increases with magnetic field and reaches 0.35 for @xmath81  mt . \n using eq . \n ( [ eq : epola ] ) we determine the magnetic field dependencies of @xmath61 and @xmath12 , as presented in fig . \n [ fig : tprlplateau](c ) . \n the electron spin relaxation time increases from 20 to 100  ns in a magnetic field of 150  mt . the plateau values corresponding to @xmath12 are symmetric with respect to magnetic field inversion and they change sign if the excitation helicity sign is reversed ( i.e. , they follow the electron spin polarization ) . \n this corroborates our conclusion about optical orientation of manganese . \n the manganese orientation is absent in zero magnetic field , in accord with @xcite , however , it appears in weak magnetic fields and saturates for @xmath82  mt in line with the @xmath35 behavior from sfrs , see fig . \n [ fig : sfrspectra](c ) . \n we can exclude any influence of dynamical polarization of lattice nuclei since nuclear polarization should appear in much smaller magnetic fields @xmath83  mt , where @xmath84 is the local field onto a nucleus by the neighboring nuclei @xcite . moreover , we do not observe any plateau in p - gaas samples doped with non - magnetic ge acceptors @xcite . \n thus , the plateau evidences manganese dynamic polarization in weak longitudinal magnetic fields , which suppress mn@xmath0 spin relaxation . \n = 8.2 cm    above we discussed the spin transfer between the localized electrons and the mn@xmath0 ions . \n this transfer occurs due to fluctuations of the exchange interaction given by the hamiltonian @xmath85 . here \n @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the electron and manganese spin operators , respectively , and @xmath88 is a constant depending on the electron probability at the mn@xmath0 site . \n apart from the fluctuation term the exchange interaction in mean - field approximation contains an expression like @xmath89 , where the exchange constant @xmath90 is the average electron probability at the mn@xmath0 site and @xmath91 is the donor filling factor . \n the first term describes the interaction of the electron spin with the effective exchange field of manganese @xmath92 ( analogue of the overhauser field ) . \n the second term corresponds to interaction of manganese spins with the effective field of the electrons @xmath93 ( analogue of the knight field ) . for small excitation densities @xmath94 , and as a result @xmath95 . \n = 6 cm    the presence of the exchange manganese field can be detected via changes in the electron larmor precession frequency in an external magnetic field . since manganese polarization is absent in voigt geometry @xcite it is necessary to perform this experiment in oblique magnetic field for @xmath20 and @xmath21 polarized excitation . \n these data are summarized in fig . \n [ fig : obliqueb ] . figure  [ fig : obliqueb](a ) shows the oscillations of the circular polarization degree of the pl in time for the two opposite helicities ( @xmath96  mt applied at an angle @xmath97 with respect to the light propagation direction ) . \n indeed we see that the larmor frequencies @xmath98 corresponding to electron spin precession with @xmath48 are different ( @xmath99  ns@xmath100 ) . \n based on this difference we can plot the dependence of the effective magnetic field @xmath101 on external magnetic field @xmath31 , as shown in fig .  [ \n fig : obliqueb](b ) . \n the clear correlation between the magnetic field dependencies of @xmath102 and the plateau value @xmath103 indicates their common origin : both are proportional to the non - equilibrium manganese polarization @xmath12 . \n one can also estimate the exchange constant @xmath90 . \n we note that in oblique magnetic fields no oscillations with the mn@xmath0 @xmath104 factor are observed . \n this indicates that the manganese orientation is parallel to the direction of the external magnetic field @xmath105 , i.e. effective optical pumping occurs only for the spin component along @xmath105 . \n therefore , the polarization @xmath106 . then in the oblique geometry the field @xmath107 . simultaneously from eq . \n ( [ eq : epola ] ) we have for the plateau @xmath108 . the ratio of @xmath109 from fig . \n [ fig : obliqueb](b ) allows one to derive @xmath110ev . \n this is in agreement with the value of @xmath111ev for mn@xmath0 in the center of the donor , giving an upper limit for @xmath90 @xcite .    in conclusion \n , we have demonstrated optical orientation of mn@xmath0 acceptors in gaas using two optical techniques . \n dynamic manganese polarization is established in weak longitudinal magnetic fields ( @xmath1  mt ) , which are required to suppress the mn@xmath0 spin relaxation . \n the optically oriented mn@xmath0 ions maintain the spin and return part of the polarization back to the electron spin system providing a long - lived electron spin memory . \n the authors are grateful to k.  v.  kavokin for useful discussions . \n this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( grant no . \n 436rus@xmath1120 - 1 ) and the russian foundation for basic research .",

    "spectral algorithms based on matrix representations of networks are often used to detect communities but classic spectral methods based on the adjacency matrix and its variants fail to detect communities in sparse networks . \n new spectral methods based on non - backtracking random walks have recently been introduced that successfully detect communities in many sparse networks . \n however , the spectrum of non - backtracking random walks ignores hanging trees in networks that can contain information about the community structure of networks . \n we introduce the reluctant backtracking operators that explicitly account for hanging trees as they admit a small probability of returning to the immediately previous node unlike the non - backtracking operators that forbid an immediate return . \n we show that the reluctant backtracking operators can detect communities in certain sparse networks where the non - backtracking operators can not while performing comparably on benchmark stochastic block model networks and real world networks . \n we also show that the spectrum of the reluctant backtracking operator approximately optimises the standard modularity function similar to the flow matrix . \n interestingly , for this family of non- and reluctant - backtracking operators the main determinant of performance on real - world networks is whether or not they are normalised to conserve probability at each node . \n many networks have a modular structure . \n social networks contain communities of friends @xcite , collaborators @xcite , and dolphins @xcite ; brain networks contain groups of correlated neurons @xcite , circuits of connected groups @xcite , and regions of connected circuits @xcite . \n similarly modular networks occur across biological domains from protein interaction networks to food webs @xcite . \n this range of applications has driven the dramatic development of  community detection \" methods for solving the core problem of finding modules within an arbitrary network @xcite . especially popular are spectral methods based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of some matrix representation of the network . \n these combine speed of execution with considerable information about the network beyond the modular structure @xcite , including the relative roles of each node @xcite and characterisation of the network s dynamical properties @xcite . \n spectral methods can fail for a range of real networks . \n these methods rely on the eigenvalues falling into two classes , the vast majority  the  bulk \"  following a well - defined distribution , and the outliers from that distribution giving information about the modular structure . \n topological features of a network unrelated to its modules , such as network hub nodes with high degree , can distort this distinction by introducing eigenvalues outside the bulk that mix with those containing information about modules@xcite . \n sparse networks often contain such network hubs and the outlying uninformative eigenvalues cause the breakdown of spectral methods @xcite . \n unfortunately many real - world networks are sparse ( see table ii in @xcite and table 1 in @xcite ) . \n krzakala et al . \n @xcite proposed a new  non - backtracking \" matrix representation of a network that solves this problem : their matrix represents a random walker on the network who can not immediately return to a node it has just left . \n the eigenspectrum of the adjacency and related matrices is closely related to properties of a random walker traversing a network . \n in particular , the eigenspectrum depends on the frequency with which the walker passes through any given node . \n as the non - backtracking matrix forbids the random walker to return to its immediately previous node , network hubs are not visited disproportionately by this random walker and the spectrum of this random walker is not distorted by the presence of hubs in the network . following this \n , newman introduced the closely - related  flow \" matrix @xcite that conserved the probability for the random walk . \n spectral methods applied to these matrices successfully recover modules in sparse networks , down to the theoretical limit for their detection in classes of model networks @xcite . \n however , as noted by newman @xcite , these represent an incomplete solution as networks containing trees can not be handled elegantly . \n because the random walker could not escape from such a tree once entered , trees are ignored despite being candidates for separate modules . in this paper \n we introduce the  reluctant backtracker \" approach , which combines the advantages of these new matrix representations by retaining the power of spectral methods for sparse networks with the ability to detect and correctly handle networks with trees . \n we show that this comes with no penalty for detection performance compared to non - backtracking and flow matrices . \n rather , we show that the main difference in performance depends on whether or not such matrix representations are normalised to conserve probability . \n this finding hints at some deeper difference in network structure than modularity alone . \n we first outline the non - backtracking @xcite and flow matrix @xcite approaches . \n both these approaches and ours start from the same representation of the network . \n assume an unweighted undirected connected network with @xmath0 vertices and @xmath1 edges without self loops . \n we convert the undirected network into a directed network with @xmath2 edges by replacing the undirected edge with directed edges in both directions ;

    "we propose to study the impact parameter dependence of the @xmath0 ratio in pb(160agev)+pb reactions . \n the @xmath0 ratio is a sensible tool to distinguish between hadronic cascade models and hydrodynamical models , which incorporate a qgp phase transition . \n # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 )    hadron abundances and ratios have been suggested as possible signatures for exotic states and phase transitions in hot and dense nuclear matter . \n bulk properties like temperatures , entropies and chemical potentials of highly excited hadronic matter have been extracted from high energy heavy ion data assuming thermal and chemical equilibrium @xcite . however , \n unambiguous signals of a phase transition into an equilibrated deconfined quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) state are still missing : the predicted change in observables , e.g. strangeness enhancement @xcite , may also be understood in hadronic non - equilibrium transport models @xcite .    in this letter , \n the variation of the @xmath0 ratio s contain the decayed @xmath1 s , while @xmath2 do not contain decays from @xmath3(@xmath1 ) s . \n ] as a function of the impact parameter b in pb(160  agev)+pb reactions is proposed as a method to distinguish equilibrium from non - equilibrium scenarios . in models based on the assumption of local thermal equilibrium ( e.g. in thermal models or hydrodynamical models ) \n the @xmath4 ratio is sensitive only to the temperature and chemical potentials achieved in the reaction . \n microscopic transport theory , however , is not constrained by equilibrium assumptions . thus , this ratio provides a sensible tool to probe the creation of a chemically equilibrated phase in nucleus - nucleus collisions as a function of centrality . \n a comparison to upcoming data by the na49 and the ceres collaborations may therefore provide an estimate of the degree of local chemical equilibration . \n the differences in the predicted centrality dependence among the discussed models can help to determine the applicability of these theories .    in the 3-fluid hydrodynamical model @xcite @xcite an equation of state with a first order phase transition to a qgp \n is used . \n we employ that model to calculate entropy production during the initial stage of the reaction as described in detail in  @xcite . to show the behaviour of the @xmath0 ratio for the chemical equilibrium case , the creation of a fireball , composed of all hadrons up to mass @xmath5  gev , with a uniform @xmath6 ratio ( entropy @xmath7 per net participating baryon @xmath8 ) and net baryon density @xmath9 is assumed . \n the 3-fluid model is used to calculate @xmath6 as a function of impact parameter b. the hadron ratios are calculated assuming chemical isochronous freeze - out at a net baryon density @xmath10 .    for @xmath11 , which is the relevant @xmath6 range for sps energies , \n the @xmath0 ratio is practically unchanged if a chemical freeze - out temperature of @xmath12  mev ( as suggested in  @xcite ) is employed instead of the freeze - out density @xmath10 ( cf . \n fig . \n [ alap ] ) .    within the urqmd model @xcite , \n the non - equilibrium dynamics is treated in a microscopic hadronic scenario . \n baryon - baryon , meson - baryon and meson - meson collisions lead to the formation and decay of resonances and color flux tubes . \n the produced , as well as the incoming particles , rescatter in the further evolution of the system . \n fig . \n [ alap ] shows the @xmath0 ratio for different impact parameters from 0  fm to 13  fm ( urqmd ) and 0  fm to 9  fm ( 3-fluid hydro+fireball ; for larger impact parameters , the assumption of a chemically equilibrated fireball may not be justified ) . \n the hydrodynamical calculation with phase transition is depicted by the black line ( using a freeze - out density @xmath10 ) and the dotted line ( using a freeze - out temperature @xmath12  mev ) , the full squares denote the - microscopic non - equilibrium - urqmd @xcite calculation .    in the 3-fluid approach \n the @xmath0 ratio stays constant with b.    in contrast , the hadronic urqmd model yields a strong dependence of this ratio on impact parameter b. the @xmath13 ratio drops rapidly with increasing b from 1.3 to 0.5 . \n the behaviour of the 3-fluid hydrodynamical model can be understood in terms of the local equilibration of the hot and dense medium . \n the temperature and specific entropy of the fluid elements are only slightly affected by b ( at least for not too large impact parameters ) . as long as the assumption of local chemical equilibrium \n is justified , the particle number densities are independent of the volume ( in the grand canonical formulation ) - thus their ratios remain constant .    in the case of the microscopic urqmd model , there is an interplay between particle production and subsequent annihilation : in peripheral ( large b ) collisions the @xmath3 production is basically the same as in proton+proton reactions . \n @xmath3 s and @xmath2 s are produced via the fragmentation of color flux tubes ( strings ) . \n the production of ( anti-)strange quarks in the color field is suppressed due to the mass difference between strange and up / down quarks . \n this results in a suppression of @xmath3 over @xmath2 by a factor of 2 ( @xmath14 in pp ) . \n in central pb+pb encounters meson - baryon and meson - meson reactions work as additional sources for the anti - hyperon and anti - proton production . \n the absolute @xmath3 , @xmath2 yield increases far above the naive p+p extrapolation . \n then , additional rescattering effects have to be taken into account in the hot and dense medium . \n anti - baryons are strongly affected by the comoving baryon density . \n the additive quark model yields smaller annihilation cross section of anti - lambdas than the annihilation cross sections of anti - protons at the same momentum : thus the annihilation probability for @xmath3 s is smaller than for @xmath2 s , leading to an increase of the @xmath0 ratio above 1 in very central reactions .    in conclusion , it has been demonstrated that a study of the impact parameter dependence of the @xmath0 ratio can be used as a powerful tool to distingush local equilibrium from off - equilibrium models for heavy ion collisions .",

    "in the galactic microquasars with double peak khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) , the ratio of the two frequencies is 3:2 . \n this supports the suggestion that double peak khz qpos are due to a non - linear resonance between two modes of accretion disk oscillations . for the microquasars with known mass \n , we briefly compare the black hole spin estimates based on the orbital resonance model with the recently reported spin predictions obtained by fitting the spectral continua . \n results of these two approaches are not in good agreement . \n we stress that if the spectral fit estimates are accurate and can be taken as referential ( which is still questionable ) , the disagreement between the predicted and referential values would represent a rather generic problem for any relativistic qpo model , as no spin influence would appear in the observed @xmath0 scaling of the qpo frequencies . the epicyclic frequencies relevant in these models are often considered to be equal to those of a test particle motion . \n however modifications of the frequencies due to the disc pressure or other non - geodesic effects may play an important role , and the inaccuracy introduced in the spin estimates by the test particle approximation could be crucial .",

    "we study resonant tunneling through quantum - dot systems in the presence of strong coulomb repulsion and coupling to the metallic leads . \n motivated by recent experiments we concentrate on ( i ) a single dot with two energy levels and ( ii ) a double dot with one level in each dot . \n each level is twofold spin - degenerate . \n depending on the level spacing these systems are physical realizations of different kondo - type models . using a real - time diagrammatic formulation we evaluate the spectral density and the non - linear conductance . \n the latter shows a novel triple - peak resonant structure . \n = 10000    quantum transport of electrons through discrete energy levels in quantum dots has been studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . in small dots \n the coulomb repulsion is strong and may yield the dominant energy scale , which gives rise to coulomb blockade phenomena ( see e.g. refs . \n @xcite for single dots and refs . \n @xcite for multiple dots ) . at high temperatures , or when the coupling between the dots and metallic leads is weak , the electrons tunnel through the system sequentially . at low temperatures and for strong coupling to the leads resonant tunneling processes contribute significantly to the current @xcite . \n the purpose of this letter is to investigate electronic transport phenomena through two ultrasmall quantum - dot systems : ( i ) a single dot with two energy levels and ( ii ) a double dot with a single level in each dot ( see fig . \n [ fg : double dot ] ) . \n we will show that the two models can be mapped onto each other . \n thus , it is sufficient to concentrate on one , the single - dot model with two levels . in both cases we assume strong coulomb repulsion between the electrons , such that we have to consider only two charge states , e.g. the empty or the singly - occupied dot system . \n we further allow for strong coupling between the quantum dot(s ) and the metallic leads adjacent to them . \n this gives rise to resonant tunneling and  as has been shown for a single dot with one energy level @xcite  nonequilibrium kondo effects . in the following \n we consider the case with vanishing magnetic field . \n accordingly the single - electron states are spin - degenerate , which is a prerequisite for kondo effects . \n we suggest that the models could be realized experimentally in a setup resembling those in refs . . \n a systematic description of resonant tunneling phenomena has been developed in refs . \n @xcite in terms of a real - time diagrammatic technique . \n it has been applied to the problems of electron transport through a single - level quantum dot as well as through a small metal island , both connected to reservoirs via tunnel junctions . in the quantum dot kondo - type effects manifest themselves as a zero - bias maximum in the differential conductance . \n furthermore , a zero - bias minimum has been predicted for the case where the level lies above the electrochemical potentials of the reservoirs @xcite . generalizing this method we calculate the spectral density of the two - level dot and the differential conductance for the current through the dot . as novel result \n we find a multiply peaked resonant structure both in the spectral functions and the differential conductance . \n when the two levels in the dot are positioned below the electrochemical potentials of the leads a triple - peak structure emerges in the nonlinear conductance : a zero - bias maximum with one satellite peak on each side . when the levels lie above the electrochemical potentials the peaks turn into notches . depending on the level spacing our model interpolates between an @xmath0 and an @xmath1 kondo - type model ( generalized to include transitions between all spin states ) . \n we denote the two energy levels of the dot by @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( the choice of @xmath4 and @xmath5 arises from the eigenstates of the double dot system ) . \n both levels are spin - degenerate , @xmath6 for @xmath7 . \n the hamiltonian is a generalization of the anderson model , @xmath8 . \n the term @xmath9 describes the isolated quantum dot . \n the interaction of the electrons in the dot is accounted for by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the electron number . \n the electrons in the reservoirs are taken to be non - interacting , @xmath12 . \n the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath13 describes tunneling between the dot and the reservoirs .    the double - dot system coupled in series between two reservoirs as shown in fig . \n [ fg : double dot ] with one spin - degenerate level in each dot is described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 . \n the hamiltonian of the two capacitively coupled dots is @xmath15 . \n in addition to the terms referring to both dots it contains an additional interaction term @xmath16 . the index @xmath17 denotes the left or right dot , respectively . \n the term @xmath18 describes the tunneling between the dots , while the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath19 is modified such that it only couples each dot to the lead adjacent to it . \n the double - dot model can be mapped onto the two - level single - dot model in the regime of large charging energy , i.e. , when @xmath10 and @xmath20 are larger than all other energy scales of the system . \n then it is sufficient to consider only two adjacent charge states of the double dot . for appropriate values of a gate voltage coupled to the dots these states are the empty and the singly charged dot system . \n then , we first solve the exact eigenstates of the double dot isolated from the leads , i.e. , the eigenstates of @xmath21 . \n they are symmetric and antisymmetric combination of the single - dot states in the left and right - hand dots @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with energies @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . \n the tunneling @xmath19 couples the leads to these new eigenstates . \n thus the effective tunneling matrix elements are @xmath24 . except for this modification of the matrix elements the double - dot system coincides with the two - level single dot . \n the mapping is not possible if we consider doubly - occupied states . \n the interaction between electrons in the same dot is stronger than between electrons in different dots . \n hence two electrons in a double dot prefer to stay in different dots , and the low energy two - electron states are formed from these single - electron states only . \n in contrast in a single dot the two - electron states are composed of all single - electron states . by symmetry , \n in the case of three and four electron states the mapping is possible again . \n physical quantities of interest can be expressed as quantum statistical averages . in particular , the d.c . \n current through the quantum dot takes the form @xmath25 the statistical average of an arbitrary operator @xmath26 can , quite generally , be expressed as @xmath27 the time integration is performed along the _ keldysh contour _ , \n i.e. , forward in time from some initial time @xmath28 to @xmath29 and then backward from @xmath29 to @xmath28 . \n the time - ordering operator @xmath30 arranges operators with respect to this keldysh contour . \n the subscript i denotes the interaction picture with respect to @xmath31 . \n the leads are assumed to be large and in thermal equilibrium . \n their electrochemical potentials are kept fixed at @xmath32 ( for r = l , r ) , and their electron distributions are described with fermi functions . \n we are interested in the time evolution of the quantum states of the dot system , and therefore consider the reduced density matrix of the dot . to do this we first expand the exponential part in eq . \n ( [ eq : average ] ) into a series of the form @xmath33 here the times of the integrals are ordered with respect to the keldysh contour , such that @xmath34 . \n the expectation value of this series is taken by tracing over the non - interacting reservoirs in the density matrices . \n we can perform the trace over the reservoir degrees of freedom exactly since the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath35 is bilinear in the lead - electron operators . \n these facts allow us to apply wick s theorem , and the forward and backward propagators become coupled due to the trace over the leads . in refs . \n @xcite a systematic diagrammatic technique has been developed for presenting the terms of the expansion eq . \n ( [ eq : expansion ] ) . \n there are well - defined rules for evaluating an arbitrary diagram and it is possible to identify and study processes of different orders .    the current can be expressed in terms of the spectral densities @xmath36 of the electron states in the dot as @xmath37          a_{i\\sigma}(\\omega).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the factors @xmath38 describe the coupling between the dot level @xmath39 and the lead @xmath40 and they are assumed to be independent of energy @xcite . \n the spectral function describes the spectrum of possible excitation of the system . in general there \n exist separate green s and spectral functions for the four states of the dot : one for each spin of each level . here \n we restrict ourselves to the zero - field case such that the levels and the corresponding spectral functions are spin - degenerate . \n in general , we can not sum up _ all _ possible contribution from the expansion eq . \n ( [ eq : expansion ] ) . \n similar as in ref . \n @xcite we proceed in a conserving approximation , taking into account non - diagonal matrix elements of the total density matrix up to the difference of one electron - hole pair excitation in the leads . in this case \n we find a set of integral equations for the spectral densities @xmath36 . while the coupling between the dot and the reservoirs is described within this approximation scheme , the double - dot states are solved exactly . \n this is reasonable when the coupling strength between the dots is at least comparable to the coupling between the dots and the leads .    in the following , \n we choose a symmetrical bias @xmath41 and consider equal - strength coupling of the dot to the leads @xmath42 . \n the resulting conductance curves are symmetrical as a function of the voltage . \n the values for the energy levels that we mention , e.g. , in the context of the illustrations , refer to the level positions before the renormalization due to tunneling . \n however , when we talk about levels being above or below the electrochemical potentials we refer to the renormalized measurable level positions . finally , we choose the temperature @xmath43 , where @xmath44 provides the energy scale , such that the thermal energies are always lower than the level spacing in the dots and much lower than the charging energy .    in the spectral densities \n @xmath45 there appear a complex , energy - dependent self - energy term which yields a broadening as well as renormalization of the dot levels . \n the energy - dependence of the self - energy term is due to the resonant - tunneling processes , and it results in a non - trivial functional form of the spectral functions . on top of this structure \n kondo - type resonances may appear as a sharp peaked structure at the position(s ) of the electrochemical potential(s ) . \n these general effects of resonant tunneling have been found already in the investigations of a single one - level quantum dot @xcite . \n we keep the lower level below the electrochemical potentials of the leads such that @xmath46 . tuning the upper level @xmath47 \n allows a crossover from the one - level limit , @xmath48 , to a fourfold - degenerate level , @xmath49 . for the single - dot model \n the level separation @xmath50 reflects the actual physical level separation , whereas it is proportional to the coupling strength between the two dots for the double - dot model . in the limit of infinite level separation \n the spectral density @xmath51 reproduces results obtained before for a single level  @xcite . \n these are the level renormalization and broadening , as well as  for @xmath46 \n kondo - type resonances at the electrochemical potentials of the leads . for a low lying level \n this corresponds to the @xmath0 kondo problem , however generalized to a nonequilibrium situation if a transport voltage is applied . \n when the second level is included , the kondo peak of the single - level model persists . \n however , the renormalization effect is stronger and , as long as @xmath52 , a further peak in the spectral functions appears ( see the dashed curves in fig . \n [ fg : split ] ) . \n this peak is shifted from the electrochemical potentials by @xmath50 below ( above ) the kondo peak in the spectral function for the lower ( upper ) level . in the other extreme of zero level separation \n we have a fourfold degenerate case , and the model corresponds approximately to a spin @xmath1 single - channel kondo model ( in the limit of low lying levels , furthermore transitions between all spin states are allowed in the present case ) . in this case \n the resulting spectral functions are equal to each other and have a much more pronounced kondo peak ( see the solid curve in fig .  [ \n fg : split ] ) than in the single level case . \n the large resonant peak , seen when @xmath49 , can be viewed as two kondo peaks being on top of each other . when the degeneracy is lifted the peak splits into two , separated by @xmath53 . \n one peak remains pinned at zero since the spin - degeneracy of the levels continues to lead to a kondo peak . \n this result differs from the situation where the spin degeneracy of a single level is lifted by a magnetic field  @xcite . when the upper level is lifted far above the lower one the properties of the system approach those of a single - level dot thus exhibiting just one kondo peak . \n the spectral functions are normalized . \n since we have neglected multiple occupancy , the normalization is @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the probabilities of an empty dot and that with single electron state @xmath57 occupied . \n this expression allows us to relate differences in the magnitudes of the spectral functions to differences in occupation probabilities , e.g. when the spectral functions corresponding to different levels are compared to each other . \n the bias voltage has the effect of splitting all the resonant peaks in the spectral functions by @xmath58 , see fig . \n [ fg : a with ev ] . \n the peaked structure of the spectral functions is reflected in a novel structure in the nonlinear conductance , see fig . \n [ fg : conductance ] . instead of a single zero - bias peak , known from the single level dot \n , there appear now three sharp resonant peaks between the broad peaks corresponding to the renormalized energy levels . \n the zero - bias anomaly , characteristic for the single level case remains , but two additional satellite peaks appear at @xmath59 . when the level separation is increased the new peaks decrease in size while the peak at zero bias remains unchanged . \n when the levels lie above the electrochemical potentials , the nonlinear conductance exhibits a triplet of minima with one minimum at the electrochemical potentials and two satellites on each side . when the levels are on opposite sides of the electrochemical potentials the spectral functions as well as the conductance show very varied structures , which are not easily classified . \n the systems considered here have not yet been investigated experimentally . \n ralph and buhrman have measured tunneling  enhanced by the kondo effect  through a localized state of an impurity equivalent to a single one - level dot . some unexplained features in their results \n may be due to the existence of the other levels above the electrochemical potentials . \n the model of a single- or two - level dot with only one electron in it could possibly be realized with the setup used by tarucha _ \n et al . _ \n @xcite . \n they argue that they can resolve situations with one or few one spin - degenerate levels and one or few electrons in the dot . \n in particular , they report that a third electron inserted into the dot finds two spin - degenerate levels whose separation can be continuously varied by a magnetic field . in this system , \n if the gate voltage is fixed near the first or third conductance peak the single- or double - level dot is realized , respectively . \n the difference should be observable in the nonlinear conductance provided that the zero - bias anomalies can be resolved . \n the relevant parameters reported in ref . \n @xcite  the coupling strength ( tunneling rate ) @xmath60 , voltage , and temperature  are already close to those used in our calculations .    in conclusion , \n we have described electronic transport through a two - level quantum dot and a single - level double dot coupled between reservoirs . \n a real - time diagrammatic technique provides a very general tool for the description of various systems , both in the perturbative and nonperturbative regime . \n we have found a novel triple - peak structure in the nonlinear conductance of these systems and suggest experiments where it is observable .",

    "the linear model , in which a set of observations is assumed to be given by a linear combination of columns of a matrix ( often termed a dictionary ) , has long been the mainstay of the statistics and signal processing literature . \n one particular challenge for inference under linear models is understanding the conditions on the dictionary under which reliable inference is possible . \n this challenge has attracted renewed attention in recent years since many modern inference problems ( e.g. , high - dimensional statistics , compressed sensing ) deal with the `` underdetermined '' setting , in which the number of observations is much smaller than the number of columns in the dictionary . \n this paper makes several contributions for this setting when the set of observations is given by a linear combination of a small number of _ groups of columns _ of the dictionary , termed the `` block - sparse '' case . \n first , it specifies conditions on the dictionary under which most block submatrices of the dictionary ( often termed block subdictionaries ) are well conditioned . \n this result is fundamentally different from prior work on block - sparse inference because ( @xmath0 ) it provides conditions that can be explicitly computed in polynomial time , ( @xmath1 ) the given conditions translate into near - optimal scaling of the number of columns of the block subdictionaries as a function of the number of observations for a large class of dictionaries , and ( @xmath2 ) it suggests that the spectral norm , rather than the column / block coherences , of the dictionary fundamentally limits the scaling of dimensions of the well - conditioned block subdictionaries . \n second , in order to help understand the significance of this result in the context of block - sparse inference , this paper investigates the problems of block - sparse recovery and block - sparse regression in underdetermined settings . in both of these problems , \n this paper utilizes its result concerning conditioning of block subdictionaries and establishes that near - optimal block - sparse recovery and block - sparse regression is possible for a large class of dictionaries as long as the dictionary satisfies easily computable conditions and the coefficients describing the linear combination of groups of columns can be modeled through a mild statistical prior . \n third , the paper reports extensive numerical experiments that highlight the effects of different measures of the dictionary in block - sparse inference problems . \n block - sparse inference , block - sparse recovery , block - sparse regression , compressed sensing , group lasso , group sparsity , high - dimensional statistics , multiple measurement vectors , random block subdictionaries",

    "a lattice of optical ring resonators can exhibit a topological insulator phase , with the role of spin played by the direction of propagation of light within each ring . unlike the system studied by hafezi _ \n et al . _ \n @xcite , topological protection is achieved without fine - tuning the inter - resonator couplings , which are given the same periodicity as the underlying lattice . \n the topological insulator phase occurs for strong couplings , when the tight - binding method is inapplicable . using the transfer matrix method \n , we derive the bandstructure and phase diagram , and demonstrate the existence of robust edge states . \n when gain and loss are introduced , the system functions as a diode for coupled resonator modes . \n the idea that photonic modes can have non - trivial topological properties , like topological states of quantum matter , originated with haldane and raghu @xcite , who predicted that a two - dimensional ( 2d ) photonic crystal with broken time - reversal symmetry can support modes analogous to those of a `` zero - field '' quantum hall gas @xcite . \n this has been confirmed experimentally , using gyromagnetic photonic crystals operating at microwave frequencies @xcite . \n that system s most striking feature is the existence of topologically protected one - way photonic edge states , which could be used for on - chip isolation @xcite . \n however , this is difficult to realize at optical frequencies , where magneto - optic effects are weak . \n different systems supporting topological photonic modes have subsequently been proposed @xcite . \n in particular , hafezi _ et al . _ \n @xcite studied a lattice of ring resonators , similar to a 2d version of the crow ( coupled resonator optical waveguide ) @xcite , in which the direction of propagation of light within each resonator acts as a two - fold `` spin '' degree of freedom . in the tight - binding ( weak - coupling ) regime , coupling waveguides can be used to implement spin - conserving hopping between adjacent resonator modes , and phase shifts in these couplers give rise to an effective vector potential in the tight - binding hopping amplitudes , with opposite signs for the two spins . with a choice of phase shifts implementing the landau gauge ( which is aperiodic in the lattice ) , the effective magnetic field can be made uniform and non - zero , which yields a photonic analog of the integer quantum hall effect in each spin sector , with a hofstadter butterfly spectrum @xcite and topologically protected edge states . \n although the system is reciprocal ( time - reversal maps the two spin sectors onto each other ) , and thus can not be used as a conventional optical isolator , hafezi _ et al . \n _  suggested that the edge states can serve as robust optical delay lines @xcite . \n the spin - dependent magnetic field in this system is reminiscent of the topological insulator model of kane and mele @xcite , which has attracted major theoretical and experimental interest @xcite . \n however , there is one major difference : the couplings in the kane - mele model have the periodicity of the lattice , and decoupling the two spin sectors reduces the model to two zero - field quantum hall systems @xcite , with zero net magnetic flux through each unit cell . in the system of hafezi _ et al . \n _ , the couplings are aperiodic and decoupled spin sectors act as _ integer _ quantum hall systems ; the tight - binding analysis seemed to imply that the periodic , zero - field system is topologically trivial @xcite . \n aperiodic couplings also impose a practical design challenge , since a variety of different couplers must be used .    in this letter \n , we show that the zero - field resonator lattice supports a topological insulator phase . \n when the inter - resonator couplings are tuned to large values beyond the tight - binding regime , the system exhibits one - way edge states , with non - zero @xmath0 topological invariant @xcite ; if the two spin sectors are decoupled , each acts as a zero - field system , like the kane - mele model @xcite . \n the system therefore behaves as a photonic topological insulator . \n previously , khanikaev _ et al . _ \n @xcite have proposed a different photonic topological insulator , which also does not require aperiodic couplings , using linear combinations of polarization states as the spin analog . however , that system relies on the special properties of metamaterials , whereas the present one uses ordinary dielectric materials and is thus considerably more feasible . \n our calculations rely on the transfer matrix method , which has previously been applied to the crow @xcite , and has a wider domain of validity for such systems than the tight - binding method @xcite . \n this method also lets us easily study the effects of gain and loss , which can produce behaviors not easily obtainable in electronic topological insulators . \n we focus on the pt ( parity / time - reversal ) symmetric lattice @xcite , which contains balanced amounts of gain and loss . \n theoretical and experimental studies have shown that pt - symmetric lattices possess unusual properties , including bifurcations between real and complex bands @xcite . \n we show that in a pt - symmetric photonic topological insulator , one edge state can be amplified while the back - propagating state of the same spin , on the opposite edge , is damped . \n the lattice thus acts as a robust optical diode for crow modes . \n the resonator lattice is shown schematically in fig . \n [ fig : couplings ] . \n a ring resonator occupies each site of a square lattice . \n its modes have a two - fold `` spin '' corresponding to the propagation direction within the ring . as proposed in ref . \n @xcite and depicted in fig .

sublattice af phase . for @xmath6 \n , we find a svbc . \n we have studied in some detail the system with @xmath17 , deep within the intermediate phase that is neither af nor svbc . \n we examine various correlation functions of this ground state on various cylinders . \n the longest correlation length that we find is for pvb order . \n the strong growth of the pvb correlation length with cylinder circumference indicates that the system is either near a quantum critical point or may have weak long - range pvb order . \n we use cylindrical ( c ) boundary conditions with open ends for our dmrg @xcite calculations . \n we label the cylinders either xcm - n or ycm - n . \n the labels x or y indicated whether a first - neighbor bond is oriented horizontally ( x ) or vertically ( y ) . for xc cylinders , m is the number of sites along a zigzag vertical column and \n n means that the periodic boundary conditions are connected with a shift of n zigzag columns to the left or right . for yc cylinders , m is the number of zigzag horizontal rows and n means the connection has a shift by n sites along a zigzag row . for example , in the xc8 - 0 cylinder , one set of edges of each hexagon lies along the x direction , and there are eight sites along the zigzag columns , which are connected periodically . \n so , the circumference is @xmath18 lattice spacings . for the yc4 - 0 cylinder , \n one set of edges of each hexagon lies along the y direction and the cylinder is connected periodically along the y direction with circumference @xmath19 lattice spacings . for the xc9 -

0 cylinder , @xmath2 is uniform along the vertical direction , but varies linearly with the horizontal position from @xmath21 at the left edge to @xmath22 at the right edge . to make the af order visible \n , we apply a staggered field at the left end of the cylinder . \n as @xmath2 increases along the cylinder , the af order decreases , becoming negligible in the intermediate phase . \n we will discuss this intermediate state in detail below . \n the svbc phase appears clearly for @xmath6 . \n this svbc phase has strong first - neighbor correlations along the vertical direction with strong horizontal second - neighbor correlations connecting them to form `` ladders '' . \n below we will determine the phase boundaries of the af and svbc phases more accurately . \n first , we estimate the boundary of the af phase . \n one technique to determine magnetic order parameters using dmrg is to put strong ordering fields on the edges of an open cylinder , and to adjust the aspect ratio @xmath23 to to minimize the finite - size effects @xcite . for both square and triangular spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnets , an aspect ratio near @xmath24 \n is found to minimize the finite - size effects . for xcm-0 cylinders with m columns , the aspect ratio is @xmath25 , which we use . for @xmath21 , we determine that @xmath26 , which is close to the value determined using monte carlo calculations in the thermodynamic limit @xmath27 @xcite . with @xmath2 increasing , \n we find that the magnetization reduces to near zero for @xmath28 in fig . \n [ mag ] . \n the various cluster sizes all point to the phase transition near 0.26 . \n this phase transition point is larger than the classical limit value of @xmath29 . \n reference @xcite claims that the neel order disappears at 0.08 ; however , the value we find here is more consistent with other studies which give @xmath30 @xcite .     for various xc cylinders . \n the inset shows how the local magnetization decays from the edge of a long xc10 cylinder for various values of @xmath2.,width=226 ]     for different xc cylinders near the transition into the svbc phase.,width=226 ]    to estimate the boundary of the svbc phase we study several xc cylinders with @xmath2 varying from 0.28 to 0.40 using the method in fig . \n [ phase ] . \n these results show the svbc phase for @xmath31 . \n we also use the entanglement entropy and its first derivative with respect to @xmath2 to estimate the phase transition point . \n we make vertical cuts between zigzag columns , the dividing line between the two parts of the system bisecting a column of horizontal bonds , and measure the entanglement entropy . \n as seen in fig . \n [ entro ] , the entropy drops in going from the intermediate phase to the svbc . \n the derivative of the entropy shows a peak around 0.37 for the xc8 - 0 cylinder , and around 0.36 for the wider xc10 - 0 and xc12 - 0 cylinders . \n in addition , the height of this peak increases with the system width , as expected for a peak indicating a phase transition @xcite . \n on xc cylinders , we find that the svbc state has strong first- and second - neighbor correlations along diagonal directions , forming diagonally oriented ladders . thus , there are two degenerate diagonal svbc states on an xc cylinder , whereas for yc cylinders there is only the one vertical svbc pattern ( fig . \n 2 ) . for an infinite two - dimensional system , \n all three of these svbc ground states would be degenerate by rotational symmetry . in the classical limit , for large @xmath2 values \n , the ground state is a spin spiral state . however , quantum fluctuations are strong enough to melt the spiral order and form the svbc , in agreement with ref . \n @xcite .    in the rest of this letter , we focus specifically on @xmath17 inside the intermediate phase @xcite . to measure magnetic correlations , we apply `` pinning '' magnetic fields at one end of the cylinder and measure the resulting magnetization pattern . unlike in the af phase \n , the induced magnetization decays exponentially from the end of the cylinder with a decay length of 2 to 3 lattice spacings for various cylinders . \n we further check the response to a local magnetic field applied to a spin at the cylinder center . \n this local magnetic field response is quite short ranged . \n it only influences its nearby surrounding sites , as opposed to generating a large region of staggered magnetization in the af phase .     on ( a ) yc7 -

1 is smaller than @xmath34 , while it is near @xmath35 for the wider yc7 - 3 and xc12 - 0 cylinders.,width=321 ]    references @xcite suggest that the intermediate phase is a pvb phase with long - range dimer - dimer correlations . \n to investigate pvb ordering we study cylinders with periodic boundary conditions that are compatible with pvb order , including yc4 - 0 , yc6 - 0 , yc7 - 3 , yc8 - 0 , xc6 - 0 , xc9 - 1 and xc12 - 0 @xcite . \n we pin the pvb pattern at the cylinder ends by the choice of which spins are kept and how long the cylinder is ( see fig . \n [ pvb ] ) . \n we define a local pvb order parameter at each site using the nearest - neighbor spin correlations on the three adjacent plaquettes . \n the plaquettes form three sublattices in the pvb phase , as labeled in figs . \n [ pvb](a ) and [ pvb](b ) , and one plaquette from each sublattice is adjacent to each site . \n let @xmath36 be the sum over the six bonds around plaquette a. then , we define the local pvb order parameter as @xmath37 near the ends of the cylinders , this order parameter is nonzero , and in general it is a complex number . \n we extrapolate this local order parameter versus the truncation error to estimate its values in the limit of large bond dimension @xmath38 . for long cylinders \n , its magnitude decays exponentially with distance from the end , with a correlation length @xmath39 that depends on the cylinder , as shown in the inset of fig . \n [ pdecay ] . \n these pvb correlations can be slightly incommensurate , particularly for the narrower yc cylinders . for the xc9 - 1 cylinder with a shifted connection \n , we measure the distance from the end along the direction perpendicular to the wrapping vector to obtain the shortest pvb correlation length @xmath39 .     for different cylinder circumferences @xmath40 at @xmath17 . \n the black circles indicate yc cylinders , while the red diamonds indicate xc cylinders . \n the straight green line illustrates the expected linear behavior at the quantum critical point of the two - dimensional system . \n the inset shows the local pvb order parameter versus distance from the end of the cylinder in lattice spacings . \n the estimated pvb correlation length @xmath39 is indicated for each cylinder.,width=264 ]    the pvb correlation length @xmath39 versus cylinder circumference @xmath40 is shown in fig . \n [ pdecay ] . \n this figure includes cylinders with all orientations , and we see that for our larger circumferences , the xc cylinders appear to have a longer pvb correlation length than the yc cylinders . if the 2d system is at a quantum critical point , the correlation length is expected to be proportional to the circumference by standard finite - size scaling . \n it appears that the correlation length actually increases faster than the circumference , suggesting that this system may have weak pvb long - range order in the 2d limit of infinite circumference .    in conclusion \n , we have studied the @xmath0 honeycomb @xmath41 heisenberg model on various cylinders extensively using dmrg . \n we find that the ground state displays a paramagnetic phase for @xmath16 . by studying pvb order on various cylinders , we find that the pvb correlation length grows at least linearly with the cylinder circumference . \n this suggests that in this phase the system is either quantum critical or has weak long - range pvb order . \n these results are compatible with an early theoretical study that a direct phase transition between an af and a pvb state is possible on the honeycomb lattice @xcite . \n we thank hong -

    "most nervous systems encode information about stimuli in the responding activity of large neuronal networks . \n this activity often manifests itself as dynamically coordinated sequences of action potentials . since multiple electrode recordings are now a standard tool in neuroscience research , it is important to have a measure of such network - wide behavioral coordination and information sharing , applicable to multiple neural spike train data . \n we propose a new statistic , _ informational coherence _ , which measures how much better one unit can be predicted by knowing the dynamical state of another . \n we argue informational coherence is a measure of association and shared information which is superior to traditional pairwise measures of synchronization and correlation . to find the dynamical states , we use a recently - introduced algorithm which reconstructs effective state spaces from stochastic time series . \n we then extend the pairwise measure to a multivariate analysis of the network by estimating the network multi - information . \n we illustrate our method by testing it on a detailed model of the transition from gamma to beta rhythms .    much of the most important information in neural systems is shared over multiple neurons or cortical areas , in such forms as population codes and distributed representations @xcite . on behavioral time scales , \n neural information is stored in temporal patterns of activity as opposed to static markers ; therefore , as information is shared between neurons or brain regions , it is physically instantiated as coordination between entire sequences of neural spikes . \n furthermore , neural systems and regions of the brain often require coordinated neural activity to perform important functions ; acting in concert requires multiple neurons or cortical areas to share information @xcite . \n thus , if we want to measure the dynamic network - wide behavior of neurons and test hypotheses about them , we need reliable , practical methods to detect and quantify behavioral coordination and the associated information sharing across multiple neural units . these would be especially useful in testing ideas about how particular forms of coordination relate to distributed coding ( e.g. , that of @xcite ) . \n current techniques to analyze relations among spike trains handle only pairs of neurons , so we further need a method which is extendible to analyze the coordination in the network , system , or region as a whole . here \n we propose a new measure of behavioral coordination and information sharing , _ informational coherence _ \n , based on the notion of dynamical state . \n section [ sec : synch - measures ] argues that coordinated behavior in neural systems is often not captured by existing measures of synchronization or correlation , and that something sensitive to nonlinear , stochastic , predictive relationships is needed . \n section [ sec : states - and - ic ] defines informational coherence as the ( normalized ) mutual information between the dynamical states of two systems and explains how looking at the states , rather than just observables , fulfills the needs laid out in section [ sec : synch - measures ] . since we rarely know the right states \n a prori _ , section [ sec : reconstruction ] briefly describes how we reconstruct effective state spaces from data . \n section [ sec : estimating - states - and - ic ] gives some details about how we calculate the informational coherence and approximate the global information stored in the network . \n section [ sec : example ] applies our method to a model system ( a biophysically detailed conductance - based model ) comparing our results to those of more familiar second - order statistics . in the interest of space \n , we omit proofs and a full discussion of the existing literature , giving only minimal references here ; proofs and references will appear in a longer paper now in preparation .",

    "we present the results of an investigation of the effects of far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation ( @xmath0 ) from hot early type ob stars on clumps in star - forming molecular clouds . \n clumps in fuv - illuminated regions ( or photodissociation regions or pdrs ) undergo external heating and photodissociation as they are exposed to the fuv field , resulting in a loss of cold , molecular clump mass as it is converted to warm atomic gas . \n the heating , if rapid , creates strong photoevaporative mass flows off the clump surfaces , and drives shocks into the clumps , compressing them to high densities . \n the clumps lose mass on relatively short timescales . \n the evolution of an individual clump is found to be sensitive to three dimensionless parameters : @xmath1 , the ratio of the initial column density of the clump to the column @xmath2 @xmath3 of a warm fuv - heated surface region ; @xmath4 , the ratio of the sound speed in the heated surface to that in the cold clump material ; and @xmath5 , the ratio of the `` turn - on time '' @xmath6 of the heating flux on a clump to its initial sound crossing - time @xmath7 . \n the evolution also depends on whether a confining interclump medium exists , or whether the interclump region has negligible pressure , as is the case for turbulence - generated clumps . in this paper , we use spherical 1-d numerical hydrodynamic models as well as approximate analytical models to study the dependence of clump photoevaporation on the physical parameters of the clump , and to derive the dynamical evolution , mass loss rates and photoevaporative timescales of a clump for a variety of astrophysical situations . \n turbulent clumps evolve so that their column densities are equal to a critical value determined by the local fuv field , and typically have short photoevaporation timescales , @xmath8 years for a 1 m@xmath9 clump in a typical star - forming region ( @xmath10 ) . \n clumps with insufficient magnetic pressure support , and in strong fuv fields may be driven to collapse by the compressional effect of converging shock waves . \n we also estimate the rocket effect on photoevaporating clumps and find that it is significant only for the smallest clumps , with sizes much less than the extent of the pdr itself . \n clumps that are confined by an interclump medium may either get completely photoevaporated , or may preserve a shielded core with a warm , dissociated , protective shell that absorbs the incident fuv flux . \n we compare our results with observations of some well - studied pdrs : the orion bar , m17sw , ngc 2023 and the rosette nebula . \n the data are consistent with both interpretations of clump origin , turbulence and pressure confinement , with a slight indication for favouring the turbulent model for clumps over pressure - confined clumps .",

[ \n gg_vs_gg]a ) . \n further details are given in @xcite .    in fig . \n [ gg_vs_gg]b the total cross section is displayed . \n two peaks due to the second and third resonance region are observed , with peaks at @xmath38 and @xmath39mev . \n there is good general agreement between the three data sets . \n the graal data @xcite fall off at high masses more rapidly than the cb - elsa data . at low energies , the taps data fall below the cb - elsa data while the peak cross sections of all 3 experiments agree reasonably well . \n the discrepancies show the difficulties of extracting total cross sections when the full phase space is not covered by the detector . \n note that the extrapolation was done differently : the cb - elsa and the a2-taps collaborations used the result of this partial wave analysis ; the graal collaboration used a simulation based on @xmath40 and @xmath41 phase space . the inclusion of both , cb - elsa and taps data , provides an additional tool to estimate the systematic error of the experimental data . the fit curves in fig . \n [ gg_vs_gg]b are discussed below . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     but are defined more precisely here . \n the helicity coupling agrees with the pdg mean value but from the variety of different solutions we estimate a larger error . \n note that our helicity amplitude is defined in the complex @xmath42 plane at the pole position of the roper . \n the elastic width ( @xmath43 ) is compatible with previous findings ( 60 - 70% ) . \n its decay fraction into @xmath23 ( @xmath44 ) is not in conflict with the pdg mean value ( 20 - 30% ) ; only the @xmath3 partial decay width deviates significantly from pdg . \n we find @xmath45 while pdg gives 5 - 10% . \n due to its larger phase space , decays into @xmath46 are more frequent than those into @xmath3 even though the latter decay mode provides the largest coupling . for a radial excitation , \n this is not unexpected : about 50% of all @xmath47 resonances decay into j/@xmath48 , more than 25% of @xmath49 resonances decay via @xmath50 @xcite . \n the large value of @xmath51 might therefore support the interpretation of the roper resonance as radial excitation . \n an alternative interpretation of the @xmath18 decay is offered by hernandez , oset and vicente - vacas @xcite who take into account the re - scattering of the two final state pions . \n the authors of @xcite do not fit data ; instead they show that they can reproduce qualitatively the phenomenology of @xmath52 decays by rescattering thus avoiding the need to introduce a genuine @xmath53 amplitude .    in this letter \n , we have presented new data on photoproduction of two neutral pions in the energy range from the 2@xmath31 production threshold up to a photon energy of 820mev ( mainz ) and up to 1300mev ( bonn ) and reported results from a partial wave analysis of this and of related reactions . \n the focus of this letter is the roper resonance . \n we show that the data are incompatible with the conjecture that conflicting results on its properties could originate from the presence of two similar resonances and their interference , where both are in the @xmath0 wave and both fall into the 1300 to 1500mev mass region . due to the fact that the roper properties are over - constrained by the data , we can rule out this possibility . \n the decay pattern is consistent with an interpretation of the roper resonance as first radial excitation of the nucleon .",

    "thermodynamics is one of the oldest and well - established branches of physics that sets boundaries to what can possibly be achieved in macroscopic systems . \n while it started as a purely classical theory , it was realized in the early days of quantum mechanics that large quantum devices , such as masers or lasers , can be treated with the thermodynamic formalism  @xcite . \n remarkable progress has been made recently in the miniaturization of heat engines  @xcite all the way to the single brownian particle  @xcite as well as to a single atom  @xcite . however , despite several theoretical proposals  @xcite , the implementation of heat machines in the fully quantum regime remains a challenge . here , \n we report an experimental realization of a quantum absorption refrigerator in a system of three trapped ions , with three of its normal modes of motion coupled by a trilinear hamiltonian such that heat transfer between two modes refrigerates the third . \n we investigate the dynamics and steady - state properties of the refrigerator and compare its cooling capability when only thermal states are involved to the case when squeezing is employed as a quantum resource . \n we also study the performance of such a refrigerator in the single shot regime  @xcite , and demonstrate cooling below both the steady - state energy and the benchmark predicted by the classical thermodynamics treatment . \n rapid progress in the experimental control of small quantum systems revives interest in the merging of thermodynamics with quantum mechanics  @xcite and poses fundamental questions : what is the smallest heat machine one can build  @xcite ? can quantum effects improve the performance of a heat engine , and if so , can we use quantum correlations as a fuel  @xcite ? \n while a lot of work in this field is focused on heat engines , we consider here another standard example of a heat machine : the absorption refrigerator . \n the first such device was invented in 1850 by the carr brothers  @xcite and was one of the first practical refrigerators used in industry . \n modern designs incorporating numerous technical improvements  @xcite remain a popular choice of refrigeration devices  @xcite . in general ( fig . \n [ fig : heat_flow ] ) , an absorption refrigerator consists of three parts : cold , hot and work bodies . \n it makes use of heat from the work body to cool down the cold one , while transferring heat to the hot body . \n although the classical thermodynamics of the absorption refrigerator is well understood  @xcite , its description in terms of quantum mechanics is still a subject of numerous theoretical studies  @xcite , and several proposals to implement it in the quantum regime using a system of superconducting qubits  @xcite or quantum dots  @xcite exist in the literature .     * \n experimental setup . \n a*. schematic of the linear rf - paul trap with three trapped @xmath0yb@xmath1 ions . \n the raman beams ( r1 , r2 , and r3 ) are responsible for applying the optical dipole force for the state preparation , and for coupling the ions motional modes to the internal state during the motional state detection . \n two ( grey ) ions are prepared in the @xmath2  dark \" state ( see methods ) . \n the radial confinement of the ions provided by radiofrequency ( rf ) potential , can be fine tuned by adjusting the offset voltage applied to the diagonally opposite trap electrodes . \n the speed of this tuning is controlled by a pair of low - pass filters ( lpfs ) . \n * b , * direction of heat flow in the absorption refrigerator . \n energy from the work body is transferred to the hot body , which pumps energy from cold body to hot body . \n the black arrows label the motional eigenmodes utilized as heat bodies ]    here we study the performance of absorption refrigeration in the quantum regime , utilizing the modes of motion of trapped ytterbium ions as the heat bodies ( fig . \n [ fig : heat_flow ] ) . \n we experimentally test two hypotheses : whether the absorption refrigerator performs better when the thermal state of the work mode is squeezed  @xcite , and whether there is an advantage when operating in the single - shot cooling regime  @xcite . \n the latter relies on coherent population oscillations that can occur among the coupled modes in the quantum system before the steady state is reached . \n the interaction hamiltonian in the system of three ions , induced by anharmonicity of the coulomb repulsion between the ions , has the form  @xcite @xmath3 where the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are the annihilation ( creation ) operators for the corresponding harmonic oscillators labeled by @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the coupling rate . here @xmath8 is the equilibrium distance between the ions , @xmath9 is the ion mass , @xmath10 is the ion charge , @xmath11 is the vacuum permittivity , and @xmath12 is the single ion axial trap frequency . the hamiltonian   is valid in the rotating wave approximation when the mode frequencies satisfy the resonance condition @xmath13 .    to understand how this absorption refrigerator works  @xcite , \n consider the following scenario : when the temperature of the work ( @xmath14 ) mode is higher than the hot ( @xmath15 ) mode , some energy tends to flow from the former to the latter . \n due to the structure of the interaction hamiltonian  , transfer of energy from ( @xmath14 ) to ( @xmath15 ) is always accompanied by energy transfer from ( @xmath16 ) to ( @xmath15 ) resulting in the cooling of the cold ( @xmath16 ) mode . at some temperatures \n this process is balanced by the flow of the energy in opposite direction , leading to an equilibrium . for thermal states \n , it then requires the mean phonon numbers @xmath17 to fulfill ( see methods ) @xmath18 if the system is initially prepared at @xmath19 away from equilibrium , the interaction hamiltonian   can only lead to mean phonon numbers @xmath20 such that @xmath21 . to demonstrate the equilibrium performance of the refrigerator , we start with all modes prepared in thermal states ( see methods ) . \n we fix @xmath22 in the hot mode and change @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for each value of @xmath23 and @xmath24 \n we measure the mean phonon numbers of the hot mode at long interaction times @xmath25 at which they have effectively converged to their long - time average values ( see fig .  [ \n fig : axial_mode_evol_and_equil ] ) . for each @xmath23 \n we find an equilibrium @xmath26 which gives @xmath27 and plot these points in panel ( e ) . for majority of the points shown on the fig . \n [ fig : axial_mode_evol_and_equil ] the temperatures @xmath28^{-1}$ ] corresponding to the mean phonon numbers @xmath29 , satisfy the condition @xmath30 that implies the refrigeration of the cold mode  @xcite . here \n @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant \n .     * absorption refrigeration demonstration . \n ( a - d ) , * the difference @xmath32 plotted against the initial cold mode phonon number , @xmath24 for different initial @xmath23 . \n the shaded curves are predictions of equation   ( blue ) and numerical simulations of   ( green ) , taking experimental uncertainty of initial state preparation into account . \n the numerical simulations of   agree well with the experiment . \n the equilibrium cold mode phonon number @xmath26 , which corresponds to @xmath33 ( dashed line ) , is determined by a linear extrapolation using two points that are closest to it . \n * e , * the obtained values are then plotted against initial @xmath23 and compared to the predictions of equation  [ eq : second_law_nbar_text ] . \n the absorption refrigeration occurs at the region at which the cold mode temperature is the lowest ( blue dots ) . \n the red dot does not reach the refrigeration effect since work mode temperature is lower . \n the green zone indicates no cooling according to inequality  . ] \n we further notice in fig . \n [ fig : axial_mode_evol_and_equil](a - d ) that experimental points systematically disagree with equation   away from equilibrium . indeed \n , the numerical simulations of   ( see methods ) predict that the system approaches a non - thermal and correlated steady state in the long - time limit . \n the steady state of each mode is then better characterized by the mean phonon number @xmath34 ( energy ) rather than temperature . \n for cooling the cold mode ( @xmath35 ) , the following inequality must be satisfied  @xcite ( see methods ) @xmath36 to investigate the cooling properties away from equilibrium , we focus on the mean phonon number of the cold mode whose temporal evolution is shown in fig .  [ \n fig : cooling_cold_mode](a - f ) . \n for @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,    we observe a nett decrease of the cold mode mean phonon number in panels ( a , b ) , equilibrium in ( c ) , and an increase in ( d - f ) . \n the data points are plotted relative to the computed long - time averages and show good agreement with theory . \n the nett difference of the final steady state from the initial mean phonon number is shown in fig . \n [ fig : cooling_cold_mode]g . again the long - time average values predicted by quantum theory match the experiment quite well , while prediction of equation   disagrees with the data . \n we next study the influence of quantum mechanical coherence . \n we prepare a squeezed thermal state of the work mode  @xcite and compare cooling performance to the case where the mode is prepared in a thermal state of the same mean phonon number . squeezing increases the mean phonon number from @xmath23 to @xmath39cosh@xmath40  sinh@xmath41 , with @xmath42 the squeezing parameter  @xcite . \n the experiment is repeated for several values of @xmath42 , keeping @xmath23 fixed . \n when @xmath42 increases ( fig . \n [ fig : cooling_cold_mode](h - k )    ) , the system undergoes a transition from heating to cooling , as can be seen from the evolution of the cold mode . \n we plot the difference of final and initial mean phonon numbers in panel ( l ) for direct comparison to the previously discussed thermal case in ( g ) . \n the nett change in the mean phonon number is now smaller , which implies that squeezing of the work mode decreases the cooling performance . \n further simulations show that , for a fixed @xmath23 , cooling is indeed most effective when no squeezing is applied at all . \n * absorption refrigerator operating in the single shot regime . \n * the difference @xmath43 between the measured initial phonon number and the mean phonon number at interaction time @xmath44 that gives the strongest cooling ( colored points ) , is shown for several @xmath23 . \n the blue shaded region corresponds to the range of predicted by   after taking the experimental uncertainty of @xmath45 into account and the green shaded region is the long time average predicted by numerical simulations . \n the uncertainty in the x - axis is the error of the fit to the measured initial work population , while the uncertainty in the y - axis represents one standard deviation of the statistical uncertainty . ] \n we now focus on the single - shot cooling method  @xcite . here \n the interaction is switched off at the right moment such that the evolution halts at a transient state with a lower mean phonon number @xmath46 than the steady state one @xmath47 . \n conversely , one would achieve a higher mean phonon number than the steady - state value in the heating regime . \n both regimes can be seen in fig . \n [ fig : cooling_cold_mode](a - f ) , where the greatest deviation of @xmath46 from the initial @xmath24 is consistently reached at about @xmath48s of interaction time , @xmath49 . \n we plot in fig . \n [ fig : eq_violation ] the difference between the initial and this value for different work mode phonon numbers @xmath23 . \n the first data point at @xmath50 has a vanishing difference since it corresponds to the system at thermal equilibrium according to \n . however , the difference increases with growing @xmath23 , and exceeds the long - time steady - state value consistently and significantly  a striking demonstration of the advantage of coherence - assisted single - shot cooling  @xcite . \n note that the cooling even exceeds the thermal equilibrium values set by  , which could be viewed as a classical thermodynamics benchmark . \n the ability to cool more efficiently and on a shorter timescale is related to the transient coherence generated during the unitary time evolution under the trilinear hamiltonian  . \n indeed , it is easily shown that an incoherent version of the trilinear interaction ( see methods ) precludes the device from cooling further than the steady - state occupation  @xcite . in conclusion , we have demonstrated an implementation of an absorption refrigerator utilizing the harmonic modes of motion in a trapped - ion system . \n we have shown that the classical concept of the absorption refrigerator can be extended to the quantum domain , and its cooling power per unit mass ( @xmath51 2.4 w / kg ) is comparable to its classical counterparts.19 w / kg . ] \n the experiment confirms our theoretical understanding of the refrigerator dynamics and its steady - state characteristics based on a coherent three - body interaction model . in particular , we could observe that , starting away from equilibrium , the system energies rapidly approach a steady state , even in the absence of environmental coupling . \n simple arguments based on equilibrium thermodynamics do not predict this steady state , although they give the correct temperature requirements for cooling . while it was shown that utilizing squeezed states allows the refrigerator to transition from a heating to cooling regime , hence demonstrating that squeezing could be used as a quantum fuel , when directly compared to the thermal work reservoir we could also observe a diminished performance of the refrigerator . \n this leads to the surprising implication that exploiting quantum resources does not necessarily enhance , but may even be detrimental to the performance of heat machines \n an issue worth studying further . on the other hand , \n we demonstrate a significant advantage with respect to both steady - state cooling and thermodynamic benchmark when we operate the refrigerator in a single - shot regime .",

    "given the importance of non - coding rnas to cellular regulatory functions and rapid growth of rna transcripts , computational prediction of rna tertiary structure remains highly demanded yet significantly challenging . even for a short rna sequence , the space of tertiary conformations is immense ; existing methods to identify native - like conformations mostly resort to random sampling of conformations to gain computational feasibility . \n however native conformations may not be examined and prediction accuracy may be compromised due to sampling . in particular , the state - of - the - art methods have yet to deliver the desired prediction performance for rnas of length beyond 50 . \n this paper presents the work to tackle a key step in the rna tertiary structure prediction problem , the prediction of the nucleotide interactions that constitute the desired tertiary structure . \n the research is established upon a novel graph model , called _ \n backbone @xmath0-tree _ , to markably constrain nucleotide interaction relationships in rna tertiary structure . \n it is shown that the new model makes it possible to efficiently predict the optimal set of nucleotide interactions from the query sequence , including the interactions in all recently revealed families . \n evident by the preliminary results , the new method can predict with a high accuracy the nucleotide interactions that constitute the tertiary structure of the query sequence , thus providing a viable solution towards _ ab initio _ prediction of rna tertiary structure .",

39/t422    introduction    although a great many innovative and exciting suggestions were made for physics investigations following the proposed 12 gev upgrade , it was eventually necessary to focus on two main themes . \n we deal with these in turn below . \n the first is the possibility of unambiguously determining the valence @xmath0 and @xmath1 quark distributions of the free nucleon in the region of bjorken @xmath2 above 0.4 ( and as close as possible to 1 ) . in particular , while the valence @xmath0 distribution is relatively well known , it has recently been realized that the @xmath1 distribution is very poorly determined in this region  at least if one requires that the determination should be demonstrably model independent . for the polarized valence distributions , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , \n the situation is even worse , with no measurements at all for @xmath2 above 0.5 . \n experiments with @xmath5he and @xmath5h targets , following the 12 gev upgrade , could resolve the longstanding problem concerning the valence @xmath1 distribution for @xmath2 up to 0.85  establishing finally whether or not the predictions of perturbative qcd are correct . \n as a by - product one would complete our knowledge of the emc effect over the full range of nuclear mass number . \n using polarized proton and @xmath5he targets one could also complete the determination of the polarized distributions @xmath3 and @xmath4 over the same region of @xmath2 . \n the result of this program would be a definitive picture of the valence structure of the nucleon , including its spin dependence . \n measurements using polarized proton and @xmath5he targets at the 12 gev facility would also allow one to definitively establish the twist-3 component of the structure functions @xmath6 and @xmath7  at least for low moments . \n this major advance would be made possible by a factor of 10 improvement in statistics over what has hitherto been possible and over a much greater range of bjorken @xmath2 : @xmath8 . from the theoretical point of view the twist-3 structure function \n provides totally novel information on the internal structure of the nucleon \n information that should be accessible to lattice qcd within the same ten year time frame .    at a \n later and more mature stage of development of the facility other exciting possibilities arise . \n one could use the knowledge of @xmath9 and @xmath4 , at relatively large @xmath2 , to test the validity of duality in this region and if it works to use it to obtain insight into these distributions for @xmath2 as large as 0.95 . \n we could also use this knowledge to test the utility of semi - inclusive measurements for determining spin and flavor dependence of parton distributions . \n if these tests are successful one could apply these methods to an accurate determination of the spin and flavor dependence of the nucleon sea in the region @xmath10 . \n finally , one could use a tensor polarized deuteron target to probe completely new structure functions such as @xmath11 for @xmath2 near and beyond 1 . \n large-@xmath2 valence distributions[sec : valence ]    the distribution of the valence quarks in the nucleon is one of its most fundamental properties . because of the relative 4:1 weighting for electromagnetic probes , the proton structure function primarily constrains the @xmath0 distribution in the proton . to determine the @xmath1 distribution requires a second measurement , traditionally using the deuteron . while the approximate treatment of the deuteron as a neutron and a proton at rest , so that @xmath12 , is not too bad for @xmath2 below ( say ) 0.4 , it breaks down badly at large @xmath2 \n nevertheless it is only in the past few years that it has been realized that a realistic treatment of the effects of fermi motion and binding in the deuteron lead to an extracted neutron structure function which is quite different from that used in all standard parametrizations of parton distributions . \n in particular , a reanalysis of slac data by melnitchouk and thomas @xcite suggested that the @xmath13 ratio may actually approach the pqcd prediction of @xmath14 @xcite , rather than 0 as @xmath15 .    while this analysis is persuasive @xcite , our knowledge of such fundamental properties should not be model dependent . \n fig . \n 1 shows the present , appalling state of our knowledge of @xmath13 at large @xmath2 . \n it is clearly vital to find a facility and a technique that allow us to map out the valence distributions in a model independent manner over the complete @xmath2 range and this problem was addressed by a number of participants at the workshop including bosted , forest , klein , leader , melnitchouk , meziani , olness , petratos and scopetta . \n it is in this context that the idea of using @xmath5he and @xmath5h targets is extremely exciting . \n the fundamental point is that charge symmetry is a very good symmetry for strongly interacting systems and these two mirror nuclei are related by charge symmetry . in the limit of exact charge symmetry \n the distribution of protons ( the neutron ) in @xmath5he would be the same as that of neutrons ( the proton ) in @xmath5h  regardless of the size of the emc effect in these nuclei ! \n a measurement of the structure functions of these two nuclei would then allow us to determine @xmath16 exactly . \n in practice there are electromagnetic corrections to be made and charge symmetry is slightly broken by the strong interaction . \n nevertheless , exact faddeev calculations of the structure of the a=3 nuclei allow us to estimate these corrections quite accurately  and to test the dependence of the nuclear structure functions on the two - nucleon potential used . in order to understand the analysis to be applied to the data we need to define the ratios : ( r^3he ) = f_2^^3he 2 f_2^p + f_2^n ; r(^3h ) = f_2^^3h f_2^p + 2 f_2^n , [ eq:1 ] and the super - ratio : = r(^3he ) r(^3h ) . \n [ eq:2 ] inverting these expressions directly yields the ratio of the free neutron to proton structure functions : @xmath17 we stress that @xmath18 extracted via eq.([eq:3 ] ) does not depend on the size of the emc effect in @xmath5he or @xmath5h , but rather on the _ ratio _ of the emc effects in @xmath5he and @xmath5h . \n if the neutron and proton distributions in the @xmath19 nuclei are not dramatically different , one might expect the super - ratio , @xmath20 to be approximately one . to test whether this is \n indeed the case requires an explicit calculation of the emc effect in the @xmath19 system . \n the super - ratio @xmath20 , calculated by afnan et al . \n @xcite , is shown in fig .  2 for the various nuclear model wave functions ( pest , rsc and yamaguchi ) , using the cteq parameterization @xcite of parton distributions at @xmath21  gev@xmath22 . \n the emc effects are seen to largely cancel over a large range of @xmath2 , out to @xmath23 , with the deviation from the central value , @xmath24 , lying within @xmath25 . \n furthermore , the dependence on the nuclear wave function is very weak . \n in addition to the dependence on the two - body force used one also needs to test the sensitivity of @xmath20 to the assumed nucleon structure functions . \n the detailed study may be found in ref.@xcite . for our purposes \n it is enough to say that while there is some sensitivity one can adopt a straightforward iterative procedure which is quite rapidly convergent , so that starting from standard distributions , like cteq , one can quickly converge to a self - consistent set of structure functions and @xmath20 . \n the corollary to this is that having determined @xmath26 and @xmath20 , one will not only pin down @xmath27 but will also determine the emc effect in @xmath5he and @xmath5h , as well as the deuteron , thus completing our experimental knowledge of the nuclear emc effect @xcite . \n this will be a vital assistance in sorting out the origin of this famous effect @xcite , especially the possible change of nucleon structure in a nuclear medium , which is fundamental to our understanding of qcd itself . \n spin dependent valence distributions    as noted earlier , the case for the determination of the spin dependent structure functions in the region @xmath28 is even clearer  there is no data in this region at all ! \n one does not even know , for example , whether the neutron spin structure function , @xmath29 , becomes positive in this region ! \n this was highlighted , for example , in the presentation of leader who made important connections to `` old fashioned '' analysing power data ( @xmath30 ) @xcite . \n it is remarkable that the focus on the `` spin crisis '' has diverted so much effort to small @xmath2 that nothing is known in the large @xmath2 region . while there is room for more work , especially on exchange current corrections ( mesons , @xmath31 s , etc . ) \n , it seems that one can determine @xmath29 relatively well from measurements with a polarized @xmath5he target @xcite , while accurate data on the proton may be simplified by the development of a better @xmath32 target . \n it is clear that jefferson lab , with the 12 gev upgrade , can provide a definitive picture of the spin dependent valence structure functions in the large @xmath2 region , thus completing one of the fundamental tasks of the international program in deep inelastic scattering . on the theoretical side , \n apart from the comparison with qcd inspired models @xcite , one can expect these distributions to be accessible to lattice qcd over the same time frame @xcite . \n twist-3 structure functions    a compelling case was presented by ji , bosted , averett , meziani and others that following the proposed upgrade , jefferson lab could determine @xmath33 for both the proton and neutron , with an order of magnitude improvement in statistical accuracy in the range @xmath34 . \n this would enable one to remove the trivial twist-2 contribution and unambiguously isolate the twist-3 piece . \n as this involves _ totally novel _ \n information on the internal structure of the target , it should provide extremely important new information on the internal structure of hadrons @xcite . \n for example , the second moment of the twist-3 part of @xmath33 , @xmath35 , involves the matrix elements @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the color magnetic field inside the hadron . this will be the first indication of the correlation of the quark and gluon fields inside a hadron . \n conclusion    the consensus of the participants at this workshop were that , following an upgrade to 12 gev , jefferson lab would be able to provide important and definitive answers to our questions concerning the spin and flavor distributions of the valence quarks in the nucleon . \n it would also be able to provide the first unambiguous information on the twist-3 structure functions of the nucleon , that is the correlations between quarks and gluons in the proton . \n this represents an outstanding physics program .    as a side benefit of the determination of the valence @xmath1 distribution we would also have accurate measurements of the emc effect in @xmath5he , @xmath5h and the deuteron for the first time , thus allowing a complete study of the nuclear emc effect and the possible change of nucleon structure in medium .    following these top priority investigations \n there are numerous other important studies to be made . \n it is vital to explore the validity of bloom gilman scaling @xcite for spin structure functions @xcite . \n as we have already seen from jefferson lab data , scaling may well work where one has no theoretical reason to justify it ( yet ) . \n if it can be shown to work one could use the technique to study a host of quantities at large @xmath2 , notably @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , etc . as explained in detail by mulders , leader and ent @xcite , \n semi - inclusive measurements allow us probe a large number of new observables . \n as emphasised by mitchell , one can also use a tensor polarized target to determine the new spin structure function @xmath11 , which is expected to be significant at large @xmath2 . \n one could investigate the spin dependence of the emc effect at large @xmath2 @xcite using @xmath42 and @xmath43 targets . \n as emphasised by brodsky and liuti , one can investigate quark and gluon correlations in the nucleon by measuring higher twist structure functions . \n as discussed by kumar , parity violation can also be exploited to study parton distributions .    in summary , there is an urgent physics case for the 12 gev upgrade in order to answer vital and topical questions which go to the heart of our understanding of strongly interacting systems .",
    "using deep high - resolution multi - band images taken with the _ very large telescope _ and the hubble space telescope , we discovered a new anomalous sequence in the color magnitude diagram of @xmath0  cen . \n this feature appears as a narrow , well - defined sub giant branch ( sgb - a ) , which merges into the main sequence of the dominant cluster population at a magnitude significantly fainter than the cluster turn - off ( to ) . \n the simplest hypothesis assumes that the new feature is the extension of the anomalous red giant branch ( rgb - a ) metal - rich population discovered by lee et al . \n ( 1999 ) and pancino et al . \n ( 2000 ) . however , under this assumption the interpretation of the sgb - a does not easily fit into the context of a self - enrichment scenario within @xmath0  cen . \n in fact , its to magnitude , shape and extension are not compatible with a young , metal - rich population , as required by the self - enrichment process . \n the to level of the sgb - a suggests indeed an age as old as the main cluster population , further supporting the extra - cluster origin of the most metal rich stars , as suggested by ferraro , bellazzini & pancino ( 2002 ) \n . only accurate measurements of radial velocities and metal abundances for a representative sample of stars will firmly establish whether or not the sgb - a is actually related to the rgb - a and will finally shed light on the origin of the metal rich population of @xmath0  cen .",

    "the electronic structure of the three - particle donor bound exciton ( d@xmath0x ) in silicon is computed using a large - scale atomic orbital tight - binding method within the hartree approximation . \n the calculations yield a transition energy close to the experimentally measured value of 1150 mev in bulk , and show how the transition energy and transition probability can change with applied fields and proximity to surfaces , mimicking the conditions of realistic devices . the spin - resolved transition energy from a neutral donor state ( d@xmath0 ) to d@xmath0x depends on the three - particle coulomb energy , and the interface and electric field induced hyperfine splitting and heavy - hole - light - hole splitting . \n although the coulomb energy decreases as a result of stark shift , the spatial separation of the electron and hole wavefunctions by the field also reduces the transition dipole . a bulk - like d@xmath0x dissociates abruptly at a modest electric field , while a d@xmath0x at a donor close to an interface undergoes a gradual ionization process . \n our calculations take into account the full bandstructure of silicon and the full energy spectrum of the donor including spin directly in the atomic orbital basis and treat the three - particle coulomb interaction self - consistently to provide quantitative guidance to experiments aiming to realize hybrid opto - electric techniques for addressing donor qubits . \n nuclear spins in semiconductors are promising candidates for solid - state qubits with the advantage of exceptionally long spin coherence times and the potential to be integrated into the existing semiconductor device technology @xcite . \n recent experiments have shown that donor nuclear spins in enriched silicon can achieve coherence times exceeding 30 minutes even at room temperature due to a semiconductor vacuum - like environment for spins @xcite . \n however , the relative isolation of the nuclear spins from their environment also makes it difficult to prepare , and readout their spin states . \n several recent experiments have utilized optical techniques to initialize and readout the donor nuclear spins in silicon by photoexcitation of a donor bound exciton - a three - particle system with two electrons and a hole bound to the donor @xcite . \n while these experiments have so far been performed on bulk donor ensembles , the techniques will offer the best rewards if extended to single donor spin qubits in the already existing design schemes of a silicon quantum computer @xcite . unlike the dominant spin readout techniques that rely on spin - to - charge conversion , optical readout can offer higher fidelities as it is not limited by temperature dependent broadening in the leads . \n = 3.4 in    [ fi1 ]    in this letter , we investigate the electronic structure of the donor bound exciton ( d@xmath0x ) in silicon under the influence of electric fields and interfaces , thus mimicking the environment of realistic devices . \n this is required since single spin readout in a quantum computer can not be achieved in a bulk environment but requires a device environment . \n the electronic states of the donor bound exciton are influenced by the complicated bandstructure of silicon including its multiple valley degeneracy in the conduction band ( cb ) , the light and heavy hole valence bands ( vb ) , the coulomb bound donor states and the three - particle fermionic interactions . \n we include all these factors in quantitative details using an atomistic tight - binding method over a silicon lattice of one million atoms , and compute the spin - resolved transition energies and transition dipoles of the d@xmath0x in a gated nanostructure . for specificity \n , we refer here only to the most common shallow donor in silicon , phosphorus . \n these methods can readily be generalized to the other shallow donors sb , as and bi , which have slightly different electronic binding energies , and also different nuclear spins and hyperfine constants . \n three - partcile excitons or trions have also been reported recently in two - dimensional materials such as mos@xmath1 @xcite and have attracted much attention as a test - bed for studying many - body interactions in a semiconductor with both spin and valley degrees of freedom . \n previous theoretical studies in bulk d@xmath0x in silicon have been performed from effective mass approximations to understand auger recombination in donors @xcite and more recently to investigate applications such as quantum hall charge sensors @xcite . \n this work presents atomistic electronic structure calculations of the d@xmath0x in a device environment for the first time , crucial for experiments to integrate optical addressing methods in a silicon quantum computer . \n a neutral p donor in bulk silicon comprises a positively charged donor core that produces a coulomb potential and binds an electron 45 mev below the conduction band edge ( also called the d@xmath0 state ) . \n if stimulated by a laser pulse of appropriate wavelength , an additional electron and a hole can be generated and bound to the impurity , forming the donor bound exciton ( d@xmath0x ) , as shown in fig . \n 1a ) for a bulk donor , with blue and red representing the electron and hole wavefunction probability densities respectively . \n the bulk transition energy from a d@xmath0 to a d@xmath0x state has been measured to be near 1150 mev @xcite . \n fig . \n 1b ) shows a schematic of the same system under an applied electric field . \n both the d@xmath0 and the d@xmath0x undergo a stark shift , however the latter is more strongly perturbed due to the larger size of the wavefunction . \n the electric field pushes the electrons and holes in opposite directions and thus changes the excitation wavelength from @xmath2 to @xmath3 . \n fig . \n 1c ) shows the combined effect of an interface and an electric field with excitation wavelength @xmath4 . in this case , the donor wave functions are also truncated by the interface . \n later , we will show the transition energies , hartree energy , wavefunctions and transition dipole moments for these three cases , as well as the interface and e - field induced hyperfine and hole splitting that can affect the spin - resolved transition energies . \n = 3.4 in    [ fi2 ]    in fig . \n 2 , a schematic of the energy levels of the d@xmath0 and d@xmath0x are shown for a bulk - like exciton and an exciton in a nanoscale device . in the d@xmath0 state , \n the hyperfine interaction between the nuclear and the electronic spins produces a singlet and a triplet splitting @xmath5 . \n the d@xmath0x has two electrons spin paired in a singlet with @xmath6 , and as a result , the spin splitting in a b - field is governed by the hole 3/2 and 1/2 total angular momentum states , which arise from the heavy hole ( hh ) and the light hole ( lh ) bands . \n if the donor is located close to an interface or subjected to an electrical field , then the transition energies of the d@xmath0x are strongly modified , as shown in fig . \n 2b ) . \n first , the presence of an interface or electric field changes the localization of all the confined particles in both d@xmath0 and d@xmath0x . as the wave functions shift and deform in space , the particle - particle interactions also change . \n we have computed this transition energy from self - consistent hartree method with tight - binding , and denote it as @xmath7 . \n second , the electric field or the interface also splits the 3/2 and 1/2 states of the hole bound to the d@xmath0x , which we denote as @xmath8 . \n this splitting is due to the effect of confinement on the hh and lh bands , which have different effective masses . \n third , the hyperfine coupling of the d@xmath0 state also changes due to the field and depth @xcite , and is denoted as @xmath9 in fig . \n 2b ) . \n details of how the spin - resolved d@xmath0x transitions can be used to initialize and readout the donor nuclear spins using an auger recombination process can be found in refs @xcite . \n = 3.4 in    [ fi3 ]    we employ an sp@xmath10d@xmath11s * atomic orbital tight - binding method with spin - orbit interaction and nearest neighbor coupling to represent the full band structure of silicon @xcite . \n more details of the methods can be found in the supplementary materials . \n first , we investigate the stark effect of the d@xmath0x when the donor is in bulk silicon . \n fig . \n 3 shows the coulomb energy , transition energy and transition dipole moment of the three - particle d@xmath0x for a bulk - like case as a function of an electric field . in the simulation , a bulk system is represented by a 30 nm @xmath12 30 nm @xmath12 30 nm of silicon lattice bounded by hydrogen passivated hard - walls on all sides . \n the donor is placed at the center of the box , and the simulation domain size is chosen such that the electronic and hole wavefunctions at zero e - field are not affected by the boundaries of the box . \n this is reasonable as the bohr radii of the d@xmath0 and d@xmath13 states are in the range of 1 - 4 nm . \n the coulomb energy of the d@xmath0x comprises of the repulsive energy between the two electrons and the attractive energy between the hole and each of the electrons . \n fig . \n 3a ) shows this three - particle coulomb energy with an e - field , computed from eq 3 of the supplementary materials ( sm ) . at low fields , \n the coulomb energy lies between 35 and 40 mevs , and decreases slightly with the field . \n it is known that the coulomb energy in the two - electron d@xmath13 state is about 43 mev at zero e - field @xcite . \n therefore , the attractive energy of the hole in d@xmath0x reduces the total coulomb energy to sub 40 mev . as the e - field \n is increased , the electron and hole wavefunctions are spatially separated steadily , and the coulomb energy decreases . an abrupt drop in the coulomb energy \n is observed in fig . \n 3a ) at about f=1 mv / m as the hole and one of the electrons ionize to opposite surfaces of the bounding box . \n the e - field produces triangular wells at the opposite surfaces ( in the cb and vb ) . \n when the energy of the bound states in these triangular wells are lower than those of the coulomb bound states ( including mutual screening between the particles ) , the electrons and holes localize at the surfaces . as a result , the large spatial separation between the three particles at ionization reduces their net electrostatic interaction . \n the transition energy required to excite a d@xmath0 into a d@xmath0x state is computed from the difference of the total energies of the d@xmath0x and d@xmath0 as given by eq 6 of the sm , and is shown in fig 3b ) on the left vertical axis . \n using the low temperature bandgap of 1.17 ev in silicon , the transition energy at zero field ( f=0 ) is 1145 mev in close agreement with the experimental measurements @xcite . \n it is to be noted that no fitting parameters are used in the d@xmath0x simulations . as the e - field \n is increased , the transition energy drops gradually untill an abrupt drop is witnessed at f=1 mv / m due to field ionization . \n overall the transition energy decreases with e - field due to both the reduced coulomb energy and the reduced energy difference between the single particle orbital energies in the cb and in the vb . a reduced transition energy with e - field , \n however , does not mean that the d@xmath0 to d@xmath0x transition becomes more likely . \n the transition probability is governed by the dipole moment between the wavefunctions which depends strongly on their spatial overlaps . \n using eq 7 of the sm , we evaluated the transition dipole moment of the d@xmath0x in fig . \n 3b ) on the right vertical axis . \n it is shown that the dipole moment is large at low e - fields and close to the f=0 value , but decreases rapidly by orders of magnitude near f=1 mv / m . as the hole and one of the electrons are ionized towards opposite surfaces , the spatial overalp of the wavefunctions of the three particles diminish abruptly , making the d@xmath0 to d@xmath0x excitation unlikely . \n = 3.4 in    [ fi4 ]    fig . \n 4 shows the spatial probability densities of the electron and hole wavefunctions with an e - field applied along the vertical direction.the first row depicts the probability distributions ( a - c ) without an e - field , showing the electrons to be tightly bound to the donor as in the d@xmath13 state @xcite . \n since the hole experiences a weak negative potential of the two electrons , its probability distribution spreads out over a larger region , but is still far from the edges of the bounding box . \n hence , the use of 30 nm @xmath12 30 nm @xmath12 30 nm box to represent the bulk - case is justified . \n the hole wavefunction assumes a more p - like structure as shown by the lower density at the core ( green ) and a larger density rim ( red ) surrounding it . as a vertical e - field of 1 \n mv / m is applied in the second row , one of the electrons remains donor bound ( d ) , while the other electron is pulled opposite the e - field towards the top surface ( e ) . \n the hole , on the other hand , is pushed towards the back surface in a direction along the e - field ( f ) . \n hence , the overlap between the three particles decreases . \n however , both the electrons and the holes still have some density at the core , showing that the ionization at this field is only partial . \n the 3rd row shows the complete ionization case at a large e - field of 2 mv / m , in which the electron ( h ) and hole wavefunctions ( i ) are fully localized near the surface . at even larger biases , \n the donor bound electron ( g ) will eventually also ionize to the surface , but this regime is not pertinent to this work .    = 3.4 in    [ fi5 ]    next , we investigate the stark effect of the d@xmath0x when the donor is closer to a surface , which is more representative of a realistic device . \n it was shown in prior works @xcite that a single electron bound to a donor in silicon can undergo strong orbital stark shift if the donor depth d from the surface is small ( typically @xmath14 6 nm ) . in this case , a large e - field can be applied without completely ionizing the donor electron . at these relatively large e - fields , \n the donor orbitals hybridize with the confined states of the triangular well at the surface , resulting in a gradual ( non - abrupt ) ionization process . \n fig . \n 5a ) shows the three - particle coulomb energy for the d@xmath0x when the donor is at 4.2 nm depth from the surface . \n the coulomb energy is still in the sub 40 mev range , but decreases slightly below the bulk value at f=0 . \n the high potential barrier at the surface not only truncates part of the wavefunction but also pushes the asymmetric charge densities a bit off the donor center with the electron wavefunctions slightly shifting deeper into the lattice and the hole wavefunction moving closer to the surface . \n the coulomb energy is maximum when the electron - hole charge densities are centered around the donor core , but decreases when the electron - hole wavefunctions are displaced from the donor core . \n a small applied e - field acts against the surface potential and pulls the electron - hole densities towards the donor core . \n hence , the coulomb energy is seen to increase at low e - fields and reaches a maximum of 39 mev . \n a larger applied field now pushes the electrons towards the surface and holes away from the surface ( acting opposite the e - field due to the surface potential ) , and decreases the coulomb energy monotonically . \n unlike the bulk case , the ionization process is gradual ( non - abrupt ) , and the coulomb energy curve appears smooth even when the hole and one of the electrons ioinize at about 10 mv / m . \n fig . \n 5b ) also shows the transition energy and dipole moments as before , however , these curves are also relatively smoother as the larger e - fields cause a gradual ionization of the electrons and holes . \n the ionizing field for the d@xmath0x is depth dependent . \n ignoring the donor potential and the inter - particle interactions , the potential drop between the donor location and the surface for electrons and holes is @xmath15 , where , @xmath16 is equal to the donor depth , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 equals the distance to the opposite surface , @xmath19 , in which @xmath20 is the thickness of the channel . \n hence , even for a donor close to an interface ( small @xmath17 ) the d@xmath0x disassociates already at moderate field strengths by removal of the hole if @xmath20 is large compared to @xmath17 . \n this is qualitatively different from field ionization of the d@xmath0 and d@xmath13 states @xcite . \n = 3.4 in    [ fi6 ]    in fig . 6 , we investigate the other two energy gaps , @xmath8 and @xmath5 , that influence the d@xmath0 to d@xmath0x transition energy , as shown in fig . \n 2b ) . \n the proximity to an interface and/or the presence of an applied field changes both the lh and hh splitting @xmath8 , and the hyperfine resonance energy @xmath5 . \n fig . \n 6a ) shows that @xmath8 increases with e - field both for bulk and interfacial donors , as the @xmath21 and @xmath22 states are affected differently , which is consistent with recent studies of boron acceptors in silicon @xcite . \n fig . \n 6b ) shows the variation of the hyperfine coupling with e - field for donors at various depths . the shift in the hyperfine coupling from a bulk donor \n can be directly evaluated using the amplitude of the d@xmath0 wavefunction at the donor site , as done in ref @xcite . \n @xmath23 for bulk - like donors ( d=15.2 nm ) varies from the bulk value of 117 mhz at small fields before abruptly diminishing to 0 as the donor ionizes . \n in contrast , @xmath23 for donors nearer to an interface can assume a continuous range of values ( 117 to 0 mhz ) depending on the field as the ionization process is gradual . \n also , much higher fields in the range of 10 - 40 mv / m can be applied to donors less than 5 nm deep without completely ionizing the d@xmath0 electron . \n there are two factors which we have ignored here , as they lie beyond the scope of this work . \n first , we have neglected exchange and correlation effects , and treated the problem within the hartree approximation for computational feasibility . \n there is a 5 mev difference between the calculated and measured bulk transition energy @xcite , as shown earlier , which could be due to this approximation . \n more justification of this approximation is provided in the sm . \n second , some residual strain has been reported recently in nano devices close to the oxide - silicon interface @xcite . \n although we have not included the effect of local strain in the calculations as it may vary from device to device , qualititatively the effect of strain is similar to that of the electric field . \n the strain may cause valley - repopulation of the donor , and reduce the weight of the electronic wavefunction in the central - cell . as a result \n , strain will reduce both the coulomb energy @xmath24 and the hyperfine coupling @xmath5 . \n in addition , strain removes the light and heavy hole degeneracy , and enhances @xmath8 , which has been shown in ref @xcite . \n we have shown that electric fields and interfaces can affect the transition energies and dipole moments of donor bound excitons in nanodevices quite siginificantly , and optical addressing techniques for donor qubits need to be aware of these changes to be successful . \n we have also performed the first atomistic electronic structure calculation of the donor bound exciton in silicon taking into account the full bandstructure and full donor energy spectrum using spin -

    "a two dimensional spring - block type model is used to model capillarity driven self - organization of nanobristles . \n the model reveals the role of capillarity and van der waals forces in the pattern formation mechanism . by taking into account the relevant interactions several type of experimentally observed patterns \n are qualitatively well reproduced . \n the model offers the possibility to generate on computer novel nanobristle based structures , offering hints for designing further experiments . \n self - assembled nanostructures , spring - block models , pattern formation , nanotubes    reproducible nanoscale patterns and structures are of wide interest nowadays for engineering components in modern small - scale electronic , optical and magnetic devices @xcite . the so - called _ bottom \n up _ \n approach for the fabrication of these nanostructures uses nanoparticles as elementary building blocks . under some specific conditions \n the nanoparticles self - organize into the desired structures @xcite . a well - known and widely explored possibility to induce \n this self - organization is to use the capillarity forces which appear during the drying of a liquid suspension of nanoparticles @xcite . \n for instance , regular and irregular two - dimensional polystyrene nanosphere arrays on silica substrates are generated by such methods @xcite . \n these patterns are used then as a convenient mask in the nanosphere litography ( nsl ) method . \n carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) are attractive materials for nanotechnology because of their interesting physico - chemical properties and molecular symmetries . in order to make them appropriate for certain applications , \n proper initial cnt configurations have to be built , and specific conditions have to be found which enable their controlled self - organization @xcite . \n this is a very ambitious and challenging task , which can be made easier by elaborating working computer models for the self - organization of cnts on substrates . \n therefore , not only experimental , but also computational studies can advance the field of nanoengineering .    in the work of chakrapani et al . \n @xcite an experimental procedure is presented in which capillary self - organization of cnts leads to puzzling cellular patterns . after the collapse and reassembly of the highly ordered , anisotropic , elastic cnts , shrinkage and crack formation occurs . \n the resulting cellular foams are visually striking , stable patterns .    , width=283 ]    the experimental procedure @xcite may be shortly summarized as follows . \n multi - walled nanotube arrays are grown on rigid silica surface by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) based on the decomposition of ferrocene and xylene . \n the resulting nanotubes have a wall thickness of ca . \n 10 nm and a diameter of ca . \n 30 nm . \n the average distance between two nanotubes is ca . \n 50 nm . \n the obtained nanotube bristle is oxidized in an oxygen plasma at room temperature and 133 pa pressure for 10 minutes and immersed in a wetting fluid . \n after the liquid evaporates , characteristic cellular type patterns are formed , i.e. the ends of nanotubes self - organize in compact walls . \n figure [ fig1 ] . shows scanning electron microscope images of some typical structures . from the figures we learn that a wide variety of structures are engineered in such manner . \n both statistically symmetric polygonal cells and rather elongated ones can be obtained by chaning the experimental conditions . \n these micrometer scale structures have many advantageous features . \n they can be elastically deformed , transferred to other substrates or floated out to produce free - standing macroscopic fabrics . \n thus , they might find potential applications as shock absorbent reinforcement in nanofiltration devices , elastic membranes and fabrics , and containers for storage or growth of biological cells . \n despite of its applications and the existence of well elaborated production protocols , the exact mechanisms responsible for self - organization of cnts into vertically aligned cellular structures is not clearly understood . \n recently , it has been argued that although we lack some basic information regarding the self - organization of cnts within a bristle , this process can be approximated with the self - organization of arrays of cnt micropillars of micron - scale diameters @xcite each consisting of thousands of cnts . \n this observation enables the construction of a computationally tractable model which operates instead of stand - alone cnts with micropillars .    in the present work a simple mechanical spring - block type model defined at mesoscopic micropillar level is considered for understanding the capillarity driven self - organization of nanobristles ( or so called `` cnt forests '' ) . \n the aim is to build a model that is able to qualitatively reproduce the variety of experimentally produced patterns . \n the model used here for describing the self - organization process of nanobristles is a mesoscopic one and is based on the mechanical spring - block stick - slip model family . \n this model family appeared in 1967 , when r. burridge and l. knopoff @xcite constructed a simple mechanical model for explaining the guttenberg - richter law for the distribution of earthquakes after their magnitude . \n the basic elements of the model are blocks and springs that interconnect in a lattice - like topology . \n the blocks can slide with friction on a planar surface . \n the original system introduced by burridge and knopoff ( bk ) is a one - dimensional model . \n it can be studied numerically and it exhibits self - organized criticality @xcite . \n the bk model gained new perspectives with the strong development of computers and computer simulation methods . \n variants of the bk model proved to be useful in describing complex phenomena where avalanche - like processes are present , pattern formation phenomena and mesoscopic processes in solid - state physics or material sciences @xcite .    recently , by using this model , we have succesfully explained the patterns obtained in capillary self - organization of nanospheres @xcite . \n motivated by this success , hereby we propose to map the capillarity driven self - organization of nanotube bristles to a spring - block system , and to understand the pattern selection process by means of computer simulations . \n , width=283 ]    first , let us consider the three - dimensional ( 3d ) model , which is very similar to the real nanotube arrangement . \n as sketched in figure [ fig2](a ) , the micropillars composed by thousands of nanotubes having fixed bottom ends are modeled by flexible strands . \n their capillary interactions are represented by non - classical springs that connect the neighboring pillars . \n the evaporation of the liquid is simulated by the stepwise increase of tension in the springs . \n this will result in the agglomeration of micropillar ends creating the final structure in the studied system .    as shown in figure [ fig2](b ) , this 3d model can be easily mapped into a two - dimensional ( 2d ) one by projecting the micropillars top ends on the surface . in the projection plane \n the micropillars bottom ends are represented as dots , and their positions are fixed on a predefined lattice . \n the movable top ends are modeled by the disk shaped blocks which can slide with friction on the 2d simulation surface . for visual purposes only , each block is connected by an extensible string with its bottom end showing the micropillars trunk . in our simplest approach there is no restriction imposed to the length of these extensible strings which means that nanotubes with infinite length are used . \n this corresponds to the real case when the nanotubes length is much grater than the linear size of the cells in the final patterns . \n the blocks ( top of micropillars ) are connected with their nearest neighbors through special springs that model the resulting forces acting between the micropillars . \n .[fig3 ]    these special springs are one key ingredient of our computational model . \n they represent the resultant interaction force acting between two micropillars immersed in suspension . \n the tension force in the spring has a complex variation with the spring - length , it s form is sketched with a red line in the top panel of figure [ fig3 ] . \n this force is the resultant of the capillary force , the electrostatic repulsion and the van der waals attraction between the micropillars . \n the form of the capillary force acting between two micro - scale rods wetted by a liquid was measured experimentally and deduced analytically , too @xcite . \n electrostatic repulsion and van der waals attraction are successfully described by the derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek theory @xcite . \n the capillary force decays inversely proportionally with distance @xmath0 . \n the resultant of all these forces reduces to zero for long distances and it has a maximum @xmath1 at distance @xmath2 of micropillars . \n our model approximates this resulting force . the special spring - force used in simulations \n is shown with solid line in the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] . for small elongations \n @xmath3 this spring acts as a classical spring with @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the spring constant and @xmath6 is its equilibrium length . for elongations \n longer than @xmath2 the spring force decays as @xmath7 where the constant @xmath8 is selected in such way that the force - elongation curve is continuous at @xmath2 . \n the maximum of the spring force at @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath1 . \n similarly with our previous models of drying granular materials @xcite or self - organizing nanosphere systems @xcite , the effects created by the evaporation of the liquid is introduced through these springs . as the liquid evaporates the meniscus accounting for the capillarity forces gets more accentuated . \n this is modeled by a step - by - step increasing of the spring constant @xmath5 . \n it has to be noted that through the drying process the maximum force in the spring @xmath1 remains unchanged since the electrostatic forces are not affected . \n accordingly , with the increasing of @xmath5 the @xmath2 value has to be proportionally lowered . \n the second key ingredient of our spring - block model ( necessary to get realistic structures ) is the capillary force resulting from the non - vertical orientation of micropillars . \n once the micropillar becomes inclined , the meniscus radius of the liquid surface in contact with the micropillar becomes grater on the top side than on the bottom side . \n this leads to an unstable state because a resulting net force @xmath9 pointing vertically downwards will act at the crossing point between the liquid surface and the micropillar @xcite , tending to incline even more the tube . here \n we denoted by @xmath10 the angle between the vertical and the tangent to the micropillar at the liquid level .    in our spring - block approach this force which is monotonically increasing with the inclination angle \n is approximated by a simple linear repulsion force @xmath11 acting between the block and its fixed bottom end ( @xmath12 denotes their distance in the simulation plane and @xmath13 is the repulsion constant ) . \n there is an additional almost hard - core  type repulsion @xmath14 which forbids blocks to interpenetrate . \n this is taken into account by the repulsive part of a lennard  jones type force which acts only when the distance between two blocks becomes smaller than @xmath6 ( dashed line on the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] ) . \n additionally to the presented forces , damping forces are considered to stabilize the dynamics . a friction ( pinning ) between blocks and surface \n is introduced . \n it can equilibrate a net force less than @xmath15 . \n whenever the total force acting on a block exceeds @xmath15 , the block slips with an over - damped motion . \n the dynamics leading to pattern formation consists of the following relaxation steps . \n first , the system is initialized . \n blocks are placed on a triangular lattice with lattice constant @xmath16 and their corresponding bottom ends are fixed at the same positions . then , the blocks are slightly dislodged in a random direction with a small random shift not grater than the half of the empty space between blocks . \n thereby , the initial imperfectness of the nanobristle is modeled . \n next , the interconnecting spring - network is build . \n the spring constant @xmath5 is selected in such way that in the initial system the spring forces are not exceeding the pinning force @xmath15 that acts on each block . \n an initially prestressed spring - block network is thus constructed .    during each simulation \n step the spring constant is increased by a small amount @xmath17 representing the increase of tension due to the evaporation of water and the system relaxes to an equilibrium configuration . in this configuration the total net force acting on each disk is lower in magnitude than the pinning threshold @xmath15 .    similarly with the modelling of drying nanosphere suspensions @xcite , the relaxation dynamics \n is realized through an over - damped molecular dynamics simulation using a fixed time - step . \n the equilibrium state in a viscous medium can be found by moving the blocks in each simulation step in the direction of the net force acting on them , and with a displacement which is proportional to the magnitude of the resultant force @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes a viscosity .    since \n the simulation steps will be chosen small enough , this simplified dynamics is able to replace the newtonian solution without loss of significant information . \n we remind here that we are not interested in the dynamics , but in the final equilibrium configuration . \n a relaxation step is finished when no disk slipping event occurs for the given spring constant value . \n it usually takes a very long time to achieve a perfect relaxation , therefore we introduce a tolerance ( @xmath20@xmath21 ) , and assume that the relaxation is completed when the largest displacement per unit time is smaller than this value . \n after relaxation is done , we proceed to the next simulation step and increase all spring constants by @xmath17 . \n this dynamics is repeated until a final , stable configuration of the blocks is reached . \n when implementing the above relaxation dynamics , several types of boundary conditions can be considered . however , as it was shown in @xcite the boundary conditions ( free , fixed or periodic ) will influence the final stable structure only in the vicinity of boundaries . in the bulk , \n the obtained structures are rather independent of this choice . \n accordingly , in the present simulations fixed boundary conditions are used and snapshots from the bulk are taken for later investigations .    the above presented model has many parameters . here , their values for our present simulations are given . \n the disk shaped blocks are considered with radii @xmath22 , and it defines the unit length in the system . after fixing the diameter of the circular simulation area @xmath23 , \n the blocks are placed on the triangular lattice having a lattice constant @xmath24 . the density ( or space filling ) of micropillars is implicitly defined by this lattice constant . \n the block sliding dynamics is governed by the viscosity @xmath25 used in the equation ( [ overdamped ] ) and the pinning threshold @xmath26 . \n the springs used in simulations are characterized by two parameters , namely the initial spring constant @xmath27 and the equilibrium distance of springs @xmath6 . by these parameters \n the unit force in our model system is defined . in order to simulate a quasi - static drying process the spring constant increasing step \n has to be a small one @xmath28 . \n the central capillary repulsion constant @xmath29 is set to be small enough that in the initial system , where the micropillars are almost vertical , not to affect the cell formation dynamics . \n later , when the walls are forming ( and the micropillars are no longer vertically aligned ) , this force becomes grater and it helps the wall formation and stabilization process . \n the used lennard \n jones force has its standard parameters set to @xmath30 and @xmath31 expressed in simulation units . \n all results presented in the following are obtained with the above choosed parameter values , unless it is otherwise specified in figure captions .    , \n @xmath32 and @xmath33 . \n the simulation time step @xmath34 is noted below the snapshots.[fig4],width=283 ]    the presented algorithm can be easily implemented and systems up to 300000 nanotubes can be simulated in reasonable computational time . as observable from the time - sequence in figure [ fig4 ] , \n the cellular patterns are formed after nucleation of voids in the spring - block network ( time step @xmath35 ) . \n a preliminary void is enlarged by the tensioned springs ( time step @xmath36 ) until the top of micropillars arrange in a final and stable cellular structure ( time step @xmath37 ) . \n the obtained dynamics resembles the pattern formation mechanism known from experimental in - situ observations @xcite .     and @xmath38 . \n the lattice constant is @xmath39 for the top left panel , @xmath40 for the top right panel and @xmath41 for the bottom left panel . \n the obtained structures are magnified on the bottom right panel.[fig5],width=283 ]    furthermore , the effect of nanotube density on final patterns is computationally investigated . \n simulations with the same parameter set are preformed for systems initialized with different lattice constants @xmath16 . by this , the space filling of the micropillar system @xmath42 is varied . here \n , it has to be noted that the micropillar density and implicitly the micropillar lattice constant are linearly connected to the real nanotube density @xmath43 and the nanotube lattice constant @xmath44 , respectively . \n if a micropillar is composed by @xmath34 nanotubes , then by simple geometrical calculations it can be shown that @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the radius of a nanotube .    in figure [ fig5 ] three different type of simulated structures are presented . for high space filling @xmath47 corresponding to lattice constant @xmath39 polygonal cellular structures are obtained similar to those on the left hand side of figure [ fig1 ] . as one can observe on the magnified cell image , at the center there is a clean area formed by radially outgoing micropillars . for intermediate space filling @xmath48 which corresponds to a lattice constant @xmath40 the micropillars self - organize into elongated cellular structures . \n the obtained structures are in qualitative agreement with the experimental structures presented in the right hand side sem images of figure [ fig1 ] . \n when interpreting the image , one has to take into account that the length scale of this snapshot is @xmath49 times smaller than the length scale of the previously discussed one . \n accordingly , the typical size of the simulated elongated structures is @xmath50 times grater than the typical size of the polygonal structures . for low space filling @xmath51 corresponding to a lattice constant @xmath41 \n the micropillars form bundled clusters resembling the recent experimental patterns of sequential assembly of self - similar nanotube clusters @xcite .    , \n @xmath52 and @xmath33 . \n [ fig6],width=283 ]    finally our simulations explored also the possibility of designing highly ordered micropatterns in nanobristles . in this sense , an experimental procedure elaborated in the last years @xcite has been reconstructed by our spring - block type simulations . \n the design procedure is based on the experimental observation that low - density regions or vacancies in the bristle play an important role in the pattern cell nucleation process .    as shown in top panels of figure [ fig6 ] , \n different kinds of highly ordered micropatterned structures have been created by etching regular vacancies with laser pulses . \n capillary self - organization in such systems yields the structures presented on the top panels of figure [ fig6 ] . \n simulations on micropillar forests with vacancies of radius @xmath53 created on rectangular and triangular lattice have been performed . \n the results are shown on bottom panels of figure [ fig6 ] . in agreement with experimental findings \n , our spring - block simulation results suggest that various micropatterns may be designed by proper preparation of the initial nanobristle taking into account that the wall of a polygon shaped cell forms approximately at the vertical bisector of two adjacent vacancies .    in conclusion , a simple mechanical , \n spring - block type model has been proposed here to model capillarity driven self - organization of nanobristles . \n the 3d problem has been mapped to a 2d model that works at the mesoscopic micropillar level incorporating real interactions known from earlier experimental findings . \n our computer simulations evidenced the role of capillary and electrostatic forces in forming the self - organized nanostructures . \n the dynamics leading to pattern formation has been also revealed . by using the same model parameters with different nanotube densities three qualitatively different types of patterns \n were reproduced . \n moreover , the possibility of designing highly ordered nanostructures has also been explored .",

    "there are strong theoretical arguments in favour of the existence of very light scalar or pseudoscalar particles beyond the standard model which have , so far , remained undetected , due to their very weak coupling to ordinary matter . \n we point out that after hera has been decommissioned , there arises a unique opportunity for searches for such particles : a number of hera s four hundred superconducting dipole magnets might be recycled and used for laboratory experiments to produce and detect light neutral bosons that couple to two photons , such as the axion . \n we show that , in this way , laser experiments searching for photon regeneration or polarization effects in strong magnetic fields can reach a sensitivity which is unprecedented in pure laboratory experiments and exceeds astrophysical limits from stellar evolution considerations . \n there are strong theoretical arguments in favour of the existence of very light scalar or pseudoscalar particles beyond the standard model which have , so far , remained undetected , due to their very weak coupling to ordinary matter . \n they arise if there is a global continuous symmetry in the theory that is spontaneously broken in the vacuum . \n a prominent example is the axion ( @xmath0 )  @xcite , which arises from a natural solution to the strong @xmath1 problem . \n the axion appears as a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken peccei - quinn symmetry  @xcite , whose scale @xmath2 determines the mass , @xmath3 and suppresses the coupling to standard model particles , @xmath4 . \n the original axion model , with @xmath5 gev being of the order of the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking , is experimentally excluded ( see e.g. ref .  @xcite and references therein ) , however so - called invisible axion models  @xcite , where @xmath6 , are still allowed . moreover , the invisible axion with @xmath7  gev seems to be a good candidate for the cold dark matter component of the universe  @xcite .    clearly , it is of great interest to set stringent constraints on the properties of such a light pseudoscalar . \n the interactions of axions and similar light pseudoscalars with standard model particles are model dependent , i.e. not a function of @xmath8 only \n . the most stringent constraints to date come from their coupling to photons , @xmath9 , which arises via the axial anomaly , @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the ( dual ) electromagnetic field strength tensor , @xmath13 is the fine - structure constant , and @xmath14 is the ratio of electromagnetic over color anomalies , a model - dependent ratio of order one . as illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : ax_ph ] , which displays the axion - photon coupling  ( [ eq : ax_ph ] ) , in terms of its mass  ( [ eq : ax_mass ] ) , the strongest constraints on @xmath9 currently arise from cosmological and astrophysical considerations . \n they rely on axion production in cosmological or astrophysical environments . only the laser experiments quoted in fig . \n [ fig : ax_ph ] aimed also at the production of axions in the laboratory .     vs. axion - photon coupling @xmath9 for various current experiments ( adapted from ref . \n @xcite , where also a detailed bibliography can be found ) and for the ones proposed in this letter ( labelled as `` laser in hera tunnel '' and `` laser in xfel tunnel '' ) . \n the laser experiments aim at both , axion production and detection in the laboratory  @xcite . \n the microwave cavity experiments aim at axion detection under the assumption that axions are the galactic dark matter  @xcite , the telescope search looks for axions thermally produced in galaxy clusters  @xcite , and the solar - magnetic  @xcite and solar - germanium  @xcite experiments search for axions from the sun . the constraint from helium burning ( hb ) stars arises from a consideration of the energy losses associated with axion production and the corresponding influence on stellar evolution  @xcite . \n it is also shown that two quite distinct invisible axion models , namely the ksvz  @xcite ( or hadronic ) and the dfsz  @xcite ( or grand unified ) one , lead to quite similar axion - photon couplings . \n [ fig : ax_ph],width=604 ]    let us discuss such laser experiments in some detail , since our proposal in this letter rests on a scaled - up version of those . \n the most straightforward and direct proposal is to set up a photon regeneration experiment . \n it may be based on the idea  @xcite to send a polarized laser beam , with average power @xmath15 and frequency @xmath16 , along a superconducting dipole magnet of length @xmath17 , such that the laser polarization is parallel to the magnetic field ( @xmath18 ) . in this external magnetic field \n the photons may convert into axions via a primakoff process ( cf . \n eq . \n ( [ eq : ax_ph ] ) and fig . \n [ fig : light_wall ] ) with a probability ( see also refs . \n @xcite ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the momentum transfer to the magnet and @xmath21 is a form factor appropriate for the magnetic region of rectangular shape considered . here \n , the approximate expression follows from expanding the sine which is valid for light axions , @xmath22 . \n if another identical dipole magnet is set up in line with the first magnet , with a sufficiently thick wall between them to absorb completely the incident laser photons , then photons may be regenerated from the pure axion beam in the second magnet ( cf . fig . \n [ fig : light_wall ] ) with a probability @xmath23 and detected with an efficiency @xmath24 . \n the expected counting rate @xmath25 of such an experiment is given by  @xcite @xmath26 if one makes use of the possibility of putting the first magnet into an optical cavity , where @xmath27 is the total number of reflections in the cavity . \n for a sufficiently light axion , @xmath28 the expected counting rate for a photon regeneration experiment according to an arrangement like in fig \n .  [ fig : light_wall ] is independent of the axion mass and a null experiment would thus yield a 90% confidence level upper limit of ) to two photons , @xmath29 , if one employs a laser polarization perpendicular to the magnetic field . \n ] @xmath30 in the mass range  ( [ eq : ax_coh ] ) . \n indeed , a pilot photon regeneration experiment  @xcite , employing for @xmath31  minutes an optical laser of wavelength @xmath32  nm and power @xmath33  w in an optical cavity with @xmath34 , and using two superconducting dipole magnets with @xmath35 t and @xmath36 m , found , taking into account a detection efficiency of @xmath37 , a @xmath38 upper limit of @xmath39  gev@xmath40 for axion - like pseudo - scalars with mass @xmath41 ev , in accordance with the expectation  ( [ sensit ] ) .    clearly , with considerable effort , a photon regeneration experiment can reach a sensitivity in @xmath42 which is comparable and even superior to the one obtained from stellar evolution , @xmath43  gev@xmath40 ( constraint labelled `` hb stars '' in fig . \n [ fig : ax_ph ] ) . \n this has been emphasized in eq . \n ( [ sensit ] ) by the choice of quite demanding benchmark parameters ) and the cavity ( @xmath27 ) in eq . \n ( [ sensit ] ) are similar to the ones used in gravitational wave detectors  @xcite . \n ] , in particular for the linear extension @xmath17 of each of the regions before and behind the wall which are endowed with a magnetic field . \n m , at the location of the present experiments . \n [ fig : hera],width=291 ]    although it sounds , at first sight , quite unrealistic to achieve these benchmark parameters in the foreseeable future , there is , indeed , a quite realistic opportunity even to surpass them : in the not so far distant future , possibly already by the end of @xmath44 , the electron positron collider hera at desy in hamburg ( cf . fig . \n [ fig : hera ] ) will be decommissioned and the @xmath45 superconducting dipole magnets , each of which achieving @xmath46  t and having a length of @xmath47  m , can , in principle , be recycled and used for a photon regeneration experiment . \n one may envisage to employ @xmath48 of those magnets aligned along one of the four straight sections of hera ( cf . \n fig . \n [ fig : hera ] ) , to supply a magnetic field of @xmath49  t over a linear extension of @xmath50  m. with such an arrangement one will be able to reach a sensitivity of @xmath51  gev@xmath40 for @xmath52  ev ( labelled `` laser in hera tunnel '' in fig .  [ \n fig : ax_ph ] ) , which is unprecedented in pure laboratory experiments , similar to the limit from stellar evolution , and competes with the designed sensitivity of the cern axion solar telescope cast  @xcite , @xmath53 gev@xmath40 for @xmath54  ev , which looks for axions from the sun .    in a later stage \n , one may think on deploying all @xmath55 decommissioned hera dipole magnets ( @xmath56  m ) in the @xmath57  km long tesla xfel tunnel at desy , in which after @xmath58 a superconducting linear accelerator will run to provide high - quality electron bunches for the x - ray free electron lasers ( xfels ) in a dedicated laboratory  @xcite ( cf . \n fig . \n [ fig : xfel_camp ] ) . \n the corresponding sensitivity , @xmath59  gev@xmath40 for @xmath60  ev ( labelled `` laser in xfel tunnel '' in fig . \n [ fig : ax_ph ] ) , has so far been only probed by microwave cavity searches for axions , under the assumption that they are the dominant part of the galactic cold dark matter ( cf . \n fig . \n [ fig : ax_ph ] ) .    both proposals , the first stage photon regeneration experiment in the hera tunnel and the second stage in the tesla xfel tunnel , share the advantage that the necessary infrastructure for running superconducting dipole magnets is already available at these sites . \n the sensitivity of both proposals , however , still does not extend to larger axion masses . correspondingly , standard axion couplings ( labelled `` ksvz '' and `` dfsz '' in fig . \n [ fig : ax_ph ] ) are beyond the reach of them . in order to probe larger axion masses , \n one may segment the @xmath61 aligned dipole magnets into @xmath62 subgroups of alternating polarity  @xcite such that the appropriate form factor , @xmath63 peaks at a nonzero value of @xmath64 , thereby giving sensitivity to higher - mass ( pseudo-)scalars . \n with such an arrangement one may gain up to an order of magnitude in mass  still remaining , however , below standard axion values . \n even larger axion masses may in principle be probed by the usage of the photon beam from one of the future x - ray free electron lasers ( @xmath65  kev in eq . \n ( [ eq : ax_coh ] ) ) instead of the one from an optical laser ( @xmath65  ev )  @xcite . however , the poor longitudinal coherence of the first generation xfel beams limits the immediate prospects of their application to axion production in an external magnetic field . they will have a longitudinal coherence length @xmath66  @xmath67 m  @xcite which is much less than the linear extension of the magnetic field @xmath68  m. under such circumstances , the expected counting rate  ( [ eq : ax_counting_rate ] ) , which tacitly assumes @xmath69 , diminishes by a factor @xmath70 and , correspondingly , the sensitivity  ( [ sensit ] ) gets worse by a factor @xmath71  @xcite . \n for example , exploiting the photon beam from the 2-stage sase 2 xfel in the tesla xfel laboratory  @xcite , with @xmath72  @xmath67 m , @xmath73  kev , @xmath74  w , and @xmath75 , one obtains , for @xmath46 t and @xmath76  km , a sensitivity of @xmath77  gev@xmath40 , for @xmath78  ev . \n this is even worse than the current limit from the above mentioned pilot photon regeneration experiment ( cf . fig . \n [ fig : ax_ph ] ) , but extends of course to higher masses . \n competitive limits from the usage of xfels can only be expected if their longitudinal coherence can be substantially improved in the future . \n a similar combination of lasers with massive linear arrangements of recycled hera dipole magnets , but without a separating wall in the middle , might be used for the search for polarization effects induced by real and virtual axion production  @xcite . \n indeed , axion production affects the polarization of laser light propagating in an external magnetic field in two ways ( see also ref . \n @xcite ) : the polarization vector of initially linearly polarized light will be rotated by an angle @xmath79 and emerge with an elliptical polarization @xmath80 , @xmath81 \\label{ax_ell } \\psi_a & = & \\frac{n_r}{2}\\,\\frac{g_{a\\gamma}^2\\,b^2\\,\\omega^2}{m_a^4}\\ , \\left [ \\frac{m_a^2\\,\\ell}{2\\,\\omega } - \\sin \\left ( \\frac{m_a^2\\,\\ell}{2\\,\\omega}\\right ) \\right]\\ , \\sin 2\\,\\theta \\approx   \\frac{n_r}{96}\\,\\left ( g_{a\\gamma}\\,b\\,\\ell \\right)^2\\ , \\frac{m_a^2\\,\\ell}{\\omega}\\ , \\sin 2\\,\\theta \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the angle between the light polarization direction and the magnetic field component normal to the light propagation vector . \n thus , by measuring both @xmath79 and @xmath80 , one can determine the mass and the coupling of the pseudoscalar  @xcite . \n the ellipticity due to light - by - light scattering in qed is much stronger than the one from axions , but calculable , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the electron mass . \n a pioneering polarization experiment along these lines has been performed with the same laser and magnets described above exploited for the pilot photon regeneration experiment  @xcite . for @xmath85  m , @xmath86  t , and @xmath87 , an upper limit on the rotation angle @xmath88  rad was set , leading to a limit @xmath89  gev@xmath40 at the 95% confidence level , provided @xmath41  ev . \n similar limits have been set from the absence of ellipticity in the transmitted beam and labelled by `` laser '' . ] .    the currently running pvlas experiment  @xcite , consisting of a fabry - prot cavity of very high finesse ( @xmath90 ) immersed in an intense magnetic dipole with @xmath91  m and @xmath92  t , will improve these bounds on @xmath9 by a factor of @xmath93 , as can be easily seen from eqs . \n ( [ ax_rot ] ) and ( [ ax_ell ] ) . \n similarly , a polarization experiment in the hera tunnel , using @xmath94 of the hera dipole magnets , is expected to improve the current limit on @xmath79 by a factor of @xmath95 to @xmath96  gev@xmath40 , for small @xmath97 , eq . \n ( [ eq : ax_coh ] ) . \n therefore , it seems that only with considerable efforts , in particular with respect to the improvement of the finesse of the cavity , a polarization experiment in the hera tunnel can reach a sensitivity to the axion - photon coupling which is comparable to the one obtainable in a photon regeneration experiment of similar size in @xmath98 and @xmath17 . \n even a state - of - the - art ( @xmath99 ) second stage polarization experiment in the tesla xfel tunnel can reach only a sensitivity of @xmath100  gev@xmath40 for small axion masses .    in conclusion \n , we have shown that in the not so far distant future , when hera has been decommissioned , there arises a unique opportunity for searches for light neutral ( pseudo-)scalars by recycling a number of hera s superconducting dipole magnets and using them for laser experiments exploiting photon regeneration or polarization . \n these experiments may reach a sensitivity in the coupling of the ( pseudo-)scalar to two photons which is unprecedented in pure laboratory experiments and exceeds , for small masses , astrophysical and cosmological limits .",

    "hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) that are observed in the galactic halo , are believed to be accelerated to large velocities by a process of tidal disruption of binary stars passing close to a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) which resides in the center of the galaxy . \n it is , however , still unclear , where these relatively young stars were born and which dynamical process pushed them to nearly radial orbits around the smbh . in this paper \n we investigate the possibility that the young binaries originated from a thin eccentric disc , similar to the one observed in the galactic center nowadays . by means of direct @xmath0-body simulations , we follow the dynamical evolution of an initially thin and eccentric disc of stars with a 100% binary fraction orbiting around the smbh . such a configuration leads to kozai - lidov oscillations of orbital elements , bringing considerable amount of binaries to close vicinity of the black hole . \n subsequent tidal disruption of these binaries accelerates one of their component to velocities well above the escape velocity from the smbh while the second component becomes tightly bound to the smbh . \n we describe the main kinematic properties of the escaping and tightly bound stars within our model and compare them qualitatively to the properties of the observed hvss and s - stars , respectively . \n the most prominent feature is a strong anisotropy in the directions of the escaping stars which is observed for the galactic hvss but not explained yet .",

\n @xmath0-theorem has been established . \n it is defined for quantum field theories , which allow a holographic description in terms of gravity . \n this is quite a restriction . \n in fact the existence of this construction seems to hinge on a special identity fulfilled for the coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath0 of the two contributions to the conformal anomaly , i.e. the euler density and the weyl tensor @xcite . for a holographic renormalisation group flow ( rg - flow ) \n these coefficients coincide . within field theory \n there are counterexamples for @xmath0-theorem conjectures based on c , while for all known field theory examples @xmath2 for the coefficient of the euler density . \n so the @xmath0-theorem should be actually dubbed @xmath1-theorem . \n + inspired by @xcite we constructed explicit examples of holographic rg - flows between two conformal field theories ( cft ) by glueing asymptotically ads - spacetimes together and studied the corresponding @xmath0-functions @xcite . \n a crucial feature of the examples was the necessity to introduce artificially a `` renormalised '' @xmath0-function in order to obtain the expected values for the central charges . \n the renormalisation must be performed in order to get rid of a divergence caused by the presence of a `` massless pole '' , which lacks a physical interpretation . \n we argued that the appearance of the divergence was an artefact of the construction , i.e. induced by the glueing procedure , which required only continuity at the gluing point . \n we speculated that for a smooth rg - flow no renormalisation must be performed . \n here we want to push the topic a little bit further by analysing a smooth example . \n we first shortly summarise the construction of the c - function and then focus on the lesson taught by the smooth model . \n + in @xcite a natural definition of a holographic @xmath0-function was proposed , the so - called `` canonical '' @xmath0-function , which is related to the ope of the stress - energy tensor @xcite as ( here in @xmath3 ) @xmath4+\\pi_{\\mu\\nu } \\pi_{\\rho\\sigma}\\left[\\frac{f(x)}{x^4}\\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for a 4-d conformal qft the function @xmath7 vanishes and \n @xmath8 becomes a constant , the so called central charge @xmath0 . \n we want to compute this 4-dimensional correlator by applying the ads / cft correspondence to the 5-dimensional gravity action below : @xmath9       - 2\\int d^d x \\sqrt{\\hat{g}}\\,k\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is done as follows . \n first one has to choose a classical solution @xmath10 of the equation of motion of the action ( [ action ] ) @xmath11 where as @xmath12 moves from zero to infinity , @xmath13 interpolates between two nearby extrema of the potential @xmath14 . \n needless to mention that we have to choose an appropriate @xmath14 , of course . \n if @xmath13 approaches one of these extrema the geometry of the metric asymptotes to ads . \n the function @xmath15 appearing above is related to the potential by @xmath16 the gravity calculation of @xmath17-correlator for a specified background flow was done in @xcite and boils down to the solution of the fluctuation equation for the linearised transverse traceless graviton ( tt ) @xmath18 which satisfies the equation @xmath19\\,e^{\\frac{d-1}{2}a(z)}\\chi(z )      & = &

] ) can be obtained via the four dimensional fourier transform of the so called flux factor @xmath20 (  @xmath21  ) , which can be constructed out of the fluctuation @xmath22 : @xmath23(z)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 the evaluation of eq . \n ( [ flux ] ) for a generic potential is the one part of the problem . \n we solved it by showing that the potentials which arise from a given background are those to which scattering theory applies . \n the solution @xmath22 of the fluctuation equation one has to choose is fixed by regularity in the ir . \n this is due to an finite action argument . \n having chosen this solution , which is unique up to a scaling , one simply considers its decomposition into two solutions with prescribed power law close to the origin . \n the solution reads for technical details see appendix [ appnotation ] . \n @xmath25\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 are the so called jost functions . here \n the jost functions contain the necessary informations about the potential . \n the flux computed in @xcite reads @xmath27 with @xmath28 ^ 2}\\,q^{2\\lambda}\\,\\log\\,q \\\\   { \\cal f}_\\mathrm{int}(q ) & = &

q)}\\label{fint}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in @xcite we observed the necessity to accomplish the definition of the @xmath0-function by a subtraction procedure in order to obtain the expected values for the central charges . \n the reason for this `` renormalisation '' could not be explained . \n relying on a heuristic argument , we conjectured that the subtraction should be absent for a continuous flow . \n + [ largeqlimit ] the jost functions @xmath29 vanishes for large @xmath30 . \n so the term @xmath31 is the only one , which survives in the large @xmath30-limit . \n it determines the central charge @xmath32 in the uv , which can be conveniently normalised by multiplying the whole flux factor with an appropriate constant . \n a practical choice is to set @xmath33 . \n the exact computation of @xmath34 turns out to be rather difficult . \n the problem is easy to understand . \n we are interested in the small @xmath30-expansion of @xmath34 and in particular in the logarithmic terms , which vanish close to zero . \n the @xmath30-expansion contains terms divergent for small @xmath30 , too . \n so we have to extract a subleading order numerically . \n + to make the task tractable , we decided to map the problem into an 2-point boundary value problem , which is numerically accessible . \n this is achieved by first rescaling the solution according to @xmath35 so that close to @xmath36 the irregular solution approaches the value 1 , while the regular solution tends to zero as before . \n any solution must be decomposable into a sum of the irregular and regular solutions . taking this and the non uniqueness of @xmath22 due to a rescaling (  see eq . \n ( [ flux ] )  ) into account one may impose at the left boundary the condition @xmath37 . \n mapping now the interval @xmath38 $ ] by means of the transformation @xmath39 to the interval @xmath40 $ ] one can single out the exponentially decaying solution by the additional boundary condition @xmath41 . thus we obtain for the definition of @xmath42 see eq . \n ( [ scatteringpotential ] ) . \n , @xmath43   { \\rm bc}:\\hspace{3ex}\\tilde{y}(0)\\,=\\,0,\\hspace{3ex}\\tilde{y}(1)&=&1\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the numerical solution of which is performed via a finite difference algorithm @xcite . \n please note that the contraction of the interval provides us with a substantial benefit . \n the equal spacing of the contracted interval means an unequal spacing on the positive line , i.e. close to zero we collect more and more mesh points . \n the two alternatives , the shooting algorithm and the solution via an integral equation , did not work . \n the first due to the peculiar boundary conditions we have to impose and the other since the numerical data lack precision we must obtain . \n + now we are going to investigate a particular example of a smooth rg - flow defined by the quantum mechanical potential @xmath44 which meets all the requirements imposed in @xcite , i.e. it is dominated at zero and infinity by the angular momentum barrier and smooth everywhere else in between . \n so it corresponds to an interpolating rg - flow . \n the result of the computation of @xmath45 is shown in fig . \n [ figurefmodell1 ] below . \n +   + the only cosmetic correction we have done here is to subtract the constant appearing in the @xmath30 expansion of @xmath46 the value of the constant is @xmath47 . \n it is important to notice that for very small @xmath30 the remaining function becomes a constant . \n again this signals the presence of a @xmath48-term in the expansion of @xmath46 , dubbed `` massless pole '' in the introduction . in order to obtain the proper behaviour of a @xmath0-function \n , we have to perform the renormalisation procedure introduced in @xcite again , i.e. we must subtract the divergence introduced by the `` massless pole '' one must subtract @xmath49 . \n the fourier transformation of eq . \n ( [ fourier ] ) is performed using a code provided in @xcite . in fig . \n [ figureboth ] we show the result of the fourier transformation after applying the renormalisation . \n the actual computation of fig . \n [ figureboth ] involves an additional trick because the numerical fourier transformation is not stable . \n instead the plot is generated by transforming @xmath46 multiplied by a gaussian distribution . \n this is merely a sort of cutoff and does not spoil the validity of the result as long as we are only interested in the behaviour at large @xmath30 . \n this is due to the fact that the fourier transformation just intertwines the region close to zero in @xmath30 with far from zero in @xmath50 and vice versa . \n the gaussian does not affect the behaviour of @xmath46 for small @xmath30 . \n + as a cross check for the validity of the content of fig . \n [ figureboth ] for large @xmath50 we just performed the inverse fourier transformation on the unrenormalised data underlying fig . \n [ figureboth ] in order to see if we can reconstruct fig . \n [ figurefmodell1 ] correctly . \n the ratio of the original data shown in fig . \n [ figurefmodell1 ] to the reconstructed ones is shown in fig . \n [ figureratio ] . \n +   + the ratio is close to one nearly everywhere with exception of @xmath30 very close to zero . \n this is not a blow for our procedure because the deviation is related to the fact that we have not tabulated the transformed function on the whole real line but just on a finite interval . \n + the sharp peak in fig . \n [ figureboth ] is a complete artefact of the multiplication by the gaussian hence completely meaningless . \n the straight line in the same figure denotes the value which must be approached for @xmath50 very large in order to represent a decline in the central charge to 2/3 of the original value . with a different sampling of the data it is possible to find the right behaviour of the fourier transform for small @xmath50 , too . the result is shown in fig . \n [ figurecmodell1 ] . \n here we have summed up the two contributions to the c - function coming from @xmath51 and @xmath52 and rescaled to make the uv - charge becoming @xmath53 . \n +   + as a comparison we computed the gravitational @xmath0-function of @xcite . in the last two papers \n a holographic @xmath0-theorem was established using the warp factor @xmath54 appearing in the metric eq . \n ( [ metrik ] ) . \n it is used to introduce a function , @xmath55 which satisfies all the properties of a @xmath0-function , i.e. @xmath56 is a monotonous function , which correctly interpolates between the uv and ir central charges . \n the factors in the definition eq . \n ( [ grav_c ] ) are chosen in order to ensure @xmath33 . \n so by construction the two @xmath0-functions , eq . \n ( [ fourier ] ) and eq . \n ( [ grav_c ] ) , can be made to become equal at @xmath36 ( cf . \n second paragraph after eq . \n ( [ fint ] ) on page ) . by a straightforward calculation \n we express the suitable normalised @xmath0-function entirely in terms of the zero mode @xmath57 of eq . \n ( [ schr1 ] ) . \n it reads @xmath58 for @xmath59 we can compute the gravitational @xmath0-function by constructing the zero mode of eq . \n ( [ schr1 ] ) applying the finite difference algorithm once more . \n the corresponding plot is shown in fig . \n [ figurec_grav_modell1 ] below . \n the horizontal line again represents the value 2/3 . \n the both @xmath0-functions coincide in their predictions for the central charge . \n +   +",

    "gamow - teller ( gt ) strength distributions of mg isotopes are investigated within a framework of the deformed quasi - particle random phase approximation(dqrpa ) . \n we found that the n=20 shell closure in @xmath0 mg was broken by the prolate shape deformation originating from the _ fp_-intruder states . \n the shell closure breaking gives rise to a shift of low - lying gt excited states into high - lying states . \n discussions regarding the shell evolution trend of single particle states around n=20 nuclei are also presented with the comparison to other approaches . \n the structure of nuclei along the valley of stability is well understood in terms of the conventional magic numbers in the nuclear shell model . in a region far from the stability , experimental studies have shown the breaking of the n=20 magic number in n=20 nuclei , such as @xmath1na , @xmath2 mg , and @xmath3al nuclei located in so called the island of inversion @xcite . the breaking comes from the burrowing of @xmath4 and @xmath5 states below @xmath6 state @xcite , which may originate from the monopole component of the nucleon - nucleon interaction by the tensor force @xcite . \n the breaking of magic numbers in the inversion island is thought as one of the interesting properties of the exotic nuclei near drip line . \n the neutron - rich nuclei around n=20 are thought to be strongly deformed because of the reduction of the n=20 shell gap . \n the deformation in nuclei becomes more important than any other periods with the recent development of rare isotope accelerator facilities , from which one may perform lots of challenging experiments related to the exotic nuclei . \n although they decay fractions of a second , their existence is imprinted on the nuclear abundances of stars through the successive nuclear reactions in the cosmos at the explosive stage of stellar evolution , such as supernovae ( sne ) explosion @xcite . \n for example , the nuclear reactions induced by the neutrinos emitted from the sne are treated as important input data for the neutrino - process @xcite . \n since the neutrinos emitted from a proto - neutron star may have tens of mev energy high enough to excite the deformed nuclei , one needs to understand more precisely the high - lying ( hl ) excited states beyond one nucleon threshold . among them , \n the gt states are of great importance because most of the charge exchange reactions are dominated by the gt transition . \n these hl gt excited states are in close association with the nuclear structure . \n one of typical instances is the gt quenching problem . \n it says that the difference of total running sums @xmath7 for gt ( @xmath8 ) transitions , @xmath9 , is usually quenched compared to the ikeda sum rule ( isr ) , @xmath10 . \n but , recent experimental data on hl gt states deduced by more energetic projectiles shed a new light on the gt states located above one nucleon threshold , whose contributions enable us to explain the quenching problem through the multi - particle and multi - hole configuration mixing @xcite .    in order to describe neutron - rich nuclei and their relevant nuclear reactions occurred in the nuclear processes , one needs to develop theoretical frameworks including explicitly the deformation @xcite . \n ref . \n @xcite used an effective separable force to the deformed quasi - particle random phase approximation ( dqrpa ) . \n realistic two - body interaction was firstly exploited at ref . \n @xcite .    in this paper \n , we apply our previous dqrpa @xcite to the nuclei in the n=20 inversion island . starting from the deformed wood saxon potential @xcite , \n we transform a physical state given by the diagonalization of total hamiltonian in the nilsson basis into the spherical basis , in which one can perform more easily theoretical calculations . \n then , _ ab initio _ brueckner g -

nucleon interaction , which is known to account for the shell evolution according to the recent shell model calculations @xcite . \n for example , t = 0 , j = 1 pairing , which is associated with the @xmath40 tensor force , may lead to the deformation compared to the t = 1 , j = 0 pairing . \n therefore , the deformation parameter adopted in this work may include implicitly and effectively such effects , because the single particle states from the deformed wood saxon potential show strong dependences on the @xmath36 , as shown in figs . 1 and 2 . \n now we discuss the gt strengths on mg isotopes whose spses heavily depend on the neutron numbers as shown in fig . \n 2 . in particular , @xmath2 mg is thought to locate in the island inversion . since the nuclei considered here are expected to have large energy gaps between proton and neutron spaces , similarly to the neutron - rich nuclei of importance in the r - process , we consider only the @xmath41 and @xmath42 pairing correlation , which have only isospin t = 1 and j = 0 interaction .    ) on mg isotopes as a function of the excitation energy @xmath43 w.r.t . \n the ground state of @xmath39 mg @xmath44 mg with the deformation parameter @xmath27 at the upper panel in fig . \n 2 . ]     used at the lower panel in fig . \n 2 . ]    in fig . \n 3 , the gt strength distributions by @xmath27 , b(gt@xmath45 ) , on mg isotopes are presented as a function of the excitation energy @xmath43 w.r.t . the ground state of @xmath39 mg @xmath44 mg for @xmath27 values \n @xcite . \n the gt strength distributions are widely scattered into the hl states owing to the deformation . actually , these hl gt states are intimately associated with the 2p-2h contributions which result from the wide smearing of some physical states around the fermi surface by the prolate deformation @xcite . \n fig.4 is the results by @xmath46 , which shows an interesting point . \n some low -

induced reaction , in particular , by the supernova neutrino , whose energy range may extend up to tens of mev @xcite .    in summary , to describe single particle states in deformed basis , we exploited the deformed axially symmetric woods - saxon potential , and performed the deformed bcs and deformed qrpa with the realistic two - body interaction recalculated in deformed basis from _ ab initio _ g - matrix based on bonn cd potential . \n results of the gamow - teller strength for mg isotopes show that the deformation effect leads to a fragmentation of the gt strength into hl states and predicts the hl gt excitations to be explored by higher energy projectiles , whose excitations may affect the neutrino process in the cosmos through the gt transition . \n they are shown to result from the wide smearing by the increase of the fermi surface energy due to the prolate deformation .    in order to properly describe the deformed nuclei , in particular , located near to stability region , the t= 0 and j = 1 _ np _ \n pairing should be also taken into account because the j = 1 pairing is believed as one of the reasons leading to the nuclear deformation . also , for the p - process nuclei , \n the _ np _ pairing could be more important than the neutron - rich nuclei because of the adjacent energy gaps of protons and neutrons . \n the calculations for the neutron - deficient nuclei in the p -

    "the phenomenon of stochastic resonance ( sr ) has been mainly studied in one - dimensional systems with additive noise . \n we show that in higher dimensional systems and in the presence of multiplicative noise , a non - linear magnetic system with a strongly periodic current can show behavior similar to that of sr but only for frequencies below the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) frequency of the system . \n such a phenomena can provide an effective way to suppress low frequency noise in spin valve magnetic sensors . \n the application of stochastic resonance @xcite to increase the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) is now well established in many physical systems @xcite and has also been shown to increase the stability of an unstable system in some cases @xcite . \n particle production in a quantum field can also be enhanced in the presence of noise @xcite . \n the snr is enhanced by adding noise to the system as it is being driven by an external periodic force . \n however until now only one - dimensional systems with additive noise and a simple bistable potential , e.g. , @xmath0 , or a potential with one metastable state , e.g. , @xmath1 , have been studied and shown to have this interesting property of increasing the snr with the addition of noise as it is being driven by a time - dependent force . \n this counter intuitive response is inherently related to the non - linearities present in these systems . \n one might therefore ask if a similar behavior can be found in more complicated systems , in particular magnetic systems .  in this letter , we give one example of such systems ; a spin valve of two magnetic layers separated by a normal conductor . \n the magnetization is inhomogeneous in the free layer and a current perpendicular to the plane ( cpp ) traverses the structure .  in this case \n a spin torque between the layers can exist and will play in the following an important role in the sr effect .    until recently , \n the ideas of stochastic resonance have not been exploited in magnetic systems . \n as far as i know , reference @xcite provides the only application we are aware of ; it applies sr to the measurement of hysteresis loops in magnetic systems described by preisach model .  in the following , we study a magnetic system with multiplicative noise and show that a stochastic resonance type behavior exist in this system and can be taken advantage of to _ selectively _ suppress frequencies from the noise spectrum . \n the system we treat is very realistic and hence more complex than previously treated systems @xcite . \n the use of strong time - dependent currents implies that our system is in a non - equilibrium state and linear response methods are obsolete for our study @xcite . \n in this letter we will attempt only a qualitative treatment of this subject aided by numerical integration of the non - linear landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation @xcite . \n we study a current perpendicular to the plane ( cpp ) spin valve with two magnetic layers ( fig . \n [ geometry ] ) , one with magnetization @xmath2 pinned along the x - axis ( reference layer rl ) while the other layer ( fl ) has a free magnetization @xmath3 . \n figure [ zerocurrent ] shows the power spectral densities ( psd ) of the thre components of the magnetization in the absence of current . \n the psd s have been normalized the same way in all the figures . \n the noise in the z component is smallest due to the demagnetization field . \n the current has an ac component in addition to the dc component . \n the source of noise in the system is due to thermal fluctuations that activates switching between two states and hence it is intrinsic to the system .  to get an energy surface with more than one local minimum \n , we bias the spin valve with an external field that is close to being perpendicular to the fixed magnetization of the rl and take into account spin momentum transfer effects @xcite between the two layers of the spin valve . \n the y - component of the external field is kept at @xmath4 while the one along @xmath5 is kept around @xmath6 . \n the layers have dimensions @xmath7 with the easy axis along the x - axis and anisotropy @xmath8 . \n the magnetization in the pinned layer is fixed by a large bias field .  hence , in this study the pinned layer is studied micromagnetically on equal footing with the free layer . \n the magnetization in this structure shows two configurations ( fig . \n [ config ] ) which are non - homogeneous and are a result of the demagnetization field , the current field and any interaction between the layers @xcite . \n in addition to stable and unstable states , the system has saddle points which are present due to the spin torque term . \n spin valve structures are useful components of giant magneto - resistance ( gmr ) sensor devices and hence the manifestations of stochastic resonance in these systems may be of practical importance .  to increase the sensitivity of a gmr sensor , the bias field on the free layer is almost perpendicular to the magnetization of the pinned layer .  it is this kind of biasing that gives rise to the @xmath9-type noise studied here since it permits the system to hop between two - states \n .  the results reported here are valid even if the pinning of the bottom layer is not perfect . \n in fact , large bias fields tend to distort the magnetization in the pinned layer but only slightly and will not contribute to the 1/f - type noise observed here . \n to analyze this system , we use the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation @xcite supplemented by the spin torque as first suggested by slonczweski @xcite ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath12 is the damping constant taken here to be equal to 0.01 . \n the effective field @xmath13 includes exchange interactions , anisotropy , the demagnetization field and the field from the current . \n the interlayer exchange is assumed small of the order of @xmath14 . \n the value of @xmath12 chosen is larger than typical values of damping in the bulk of a permalloy .  in a geometry such as ours , \n the damping is dominated by interfacial damping and 0.01 is a reasonable value for it @xcite . \n the noise is assumed white gaussian , @xmath15 with @xmath16 and using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) , @xmath17 is proportional to the temperature @xmath18 and inversely proportional to the volume @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xcite . \n however , as we have shown in @xcite , in the presence of a bias voltage the fdt is strictly not applicable unless we restrict our region of interest to frequencies close to the fmr frequency of the system .  in the following , \n we assume that fdt is still applicable . \n @xmath21 is the direction of the magnetization in the rl . \n the current @xmath22 has one static component and another one with frequency @xmath23 . \n the form of the spin torque in the presence of ac currents still has the same form as in the slonczewski equation . \n zhu et al . \n @xcite calculated the ac spin torque in a magnetic tunnel junctions and found it to be very close in form to the static case .  among other things \n , they found that at low frequencies , the total spin torque can become less than the spin torque of the static component of the current . \n hence an ac current can introduce a partial self - cancellation of the spin torque . \n therefore we expect the ac spin torque to affect the noise spectrum of a magnetic system in a nontrivial way . \n the noise or spectral density functions of the system are calculated numerically since for time dependent systems the fluctuation dissipation relations are invalid @xcite . \n the current flows along the z - direction perpendicular to the xy plane of the magnetic layers . \n the magnetization of the rl is fixed along the x - direction . \n the fmr frequency for this system is around @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \n the constant @xmath26 .  in magnetic recording , e.g . \n , such devices operate at frequencies below the fmr frequency and hence this system is considered noisy to be useful as a sensor .  one possible way to address this problem is to seek a way to suppress the noise for frequencies less than @xmath27 and may be shift the noise to higher frequencies which is outside the operational range of the device . \n in this sense we are selectively suppressing the noise below the fmr frequency only . \n previous applications of stochastic resonance were interested in suppressing the noise around the frequency of the driving force which is usually the signal to be measured .    from fig.[xac0 ] , we observe that it is the x - component of the magnetization of the fl that is the noisiest and hence this would interfere with the gmr signal . \n the out - of plane z - component of the magnetization is very quiet due to the demagnetization field . \n fig . \n [ xtac0 ] shows that the source of the noise is from the switching of the magnetization between two configurations . \n one with an average x - component of about @xmath28 and the other less stable one with an average x - component around @xmath29 .  the spectral noise in the y and z components show more than the usual fmr peak since the system is not in equilibrium . \n the higher order harmonics are due to non - homogeneity of the magnetization , i.e. , spin waves .    in fig . \n [ xt5nac0 ] , we change the sign of the current to show the effect of the spin torque on the magnetization and noise .  in this case \n , the magnetization spends almost equal time in both states . \n this suggests the use of the spin torque itself as a regulator of the transition rate between two bistable states .  in this letter \n , we will not pursue this idea further and instead we want to explore the idea of adding a strongly periodic current in addition to the dc bias current in order to suppress the noise for frequencies below @xmath27 . \n figure [ xac5 ] shows the result of applying an ac current with amplitude equal to the bias current and a frequency of about @xmath30 for the same system of fig . [ xac0 ] . \n the noise spectrum for frequencies below @xmath31 is greatly suppressed by this additional current source . \n however now the peak around the fmr frequency is much more pronounced and so does its width . \n the second narrow peak is that of the ac current .  a closer look at the real time behavior of the x - component of the magnetization , fig . \n [ xac5 t ] , implies that the original energy barrier is no longer present . \n the strong periodic current which in turn induces a periodic spin torque is driving the system and making it less sensitive to random thermal fluctuations which are the source of the low frequency .  to be an effective suppressant , the frequency of the torque has to be outside the bandwidth of the sensor device . \n finally , fig . \n [ xac0ht1 ] shows that an increase in the frequency of the ac current degrades the effectiveness of the ac current component to suppress the low frequency noise . \n we found for this example , that for current amplitudes at @xmath32 , the maximum frequency the current should have is about twice the fmr frequency of the system . \n this latter criterion seems to depend strongly on the energy surface and hence there is no universal behavior as in the bistable one dimensional well where the frequency of the driving force is the inverse of twice the inter - well transition time .    in summary \n , we have shown that the ideas of sr are still attractive even for complex systems which can not be described by a one dimensional potential .  in higher dimensions and in the presence of a spin torque , \n saddle point states become available to the system and may invalidate the ideas of stochastic resonance .  in this letter \n , we showed that a strongly periodic current can suppress thermally induced jumps between a stable and a metastable state and hence suppresses the low frequency noise and enhance the fmr peak in the spin valve . \n _ this work is based on work done in the fall of 2004 at seagate research and will not be published elsewhere . \n it is merely a compilation of numerical observations . \n the author hopes to convince others that there is an interesting interplay of noise and time - dependent spin torques in cpp spin valves that is worth exploring in a more systematic way than attempted here . _",

@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the antisymmetric tensors in flavor and color spaces , respectively . \n the covariant derivative and the field strength tensor are defined as    @xmath16    to evaluate loop diagrams we use a three - momentum cutoff @xmath17 . \n hence , the model has two phenomenological model parameters , the cutoff @xmath17 and the diquark coupling @xmath18 . \n we use @xmath19  mev throughout this paper , but we consider @xmath18 as a free parameter . henceforth , in order to specify the diquark coupling we use @xmath20 which is the value of the 2sc gap at @xmath21 ( see below ) .    in @xmath2-equilibrated neutral 2sc / g2sc matter \n , the elements of the diagonal matrix of quark chemical potentials @xmath22 are given by    @xmath23    with @xmath24 in a gauge theory , the self - consistent solution of the yang - mills equations requires background gauge fields @xcite . \n these can be viewed as electric- and color - chemical potentials which ensure electric and color - charge neutrality of the system . \n note that a generalization of this holds true even in the case of inhomogeneous phases . \n then , of course , the corresponding fields would not be constant in space . \n instead , they would have a constant central value contribution and , on top of it , a coordinate - dependent modulation describing color - electric fields induced by the inhomogeneities . \n the constant contribution would take care of the _ global _ neutrality , while the modulation describes the local field needed to prevent the _ local _ flow of currents .    on the other hand , in njl - type models without dynamic gauge fields , one has to ensure electric and color - charge neutrality by introducing appropriate chemical potentials by hand @xcite . in the case of the 2sc / g2sc phases , \n we only require an electron chemical potential @xmath25 , and a color - chemical potential @xmath26 which ensures that the color - charge density @xmath27 is zero . in principle , \n in other phases like the gluonic phase one has to check that no other color - charge density is non - vanishing and necessitates the introduction of a respective color - chemical potential . \n indeed , the gluonic phase introduced in ref . \n @xcite requires a non - vanishing temporal component of the gluon field of the third color , @xmath28 . in our gauged njl model , \n this is equivalent to a non - vanishing color - chemical potential @xmath29 besides @xmath26 . in this first exploratory study \n , however , we use the fact that both @xmath29 and @xmath26 are known to be numerically small and we simply neglect them .    in nambu - gorkov space , the inverse full quark propagator @xmath30 is written as @xmath31 with    @xmath32    and @xmath33 here @xmath34 is a matrix in flavor space . following the usual convention \n , we choose the diquark condensate to point in the third ( blue ) direction in color space .    in the one - loop approximation , \n the free energy of two - flavor quark matter at @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where `` det '' stands for the determinant in dirac , flavor , color , and nambu - gorkov space . \n unlike the free energy in ref . \n @xcite , eq .  ( [ eqn : omega1 ] ) does not have a quartic term in @xmath37 . \n this is because we neglected the color - chemical potential @xmath26 and , in addition , we take into account only one dynamic gluonic field ( see below ) .    in the gluonic phase @xcite , the chromomagnetic instability at @xmath38 triggers a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value of the spatial component of @xmath39 ( for a simpler version of such a phenomenon , see also ref . \n @xcite . ) using the @xmath40 rotational symmetry and the @xmath41 color symmetry , one can choose @xmath42 without loss of generality . \n consequently , the non - zero vacuum expectation value of @xmath43 breaks @xmath40 , leaving only @xmath44 @xcite . \n furthermore , a non - vanishing @xmath43 together with @xmath45 and @xmath25 breaks the original symmetry of qcd down to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a subgroup of the @xmath48 chiral symmetry and the charge @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the flavor matrix of the electric charges of quarks . \n the reduced symmetry of the ground state with @xmath52 allows for additional condensates , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . \n in fact , as discussed in ref . \n @xcite , such condensates are required by the equation of motion . \n as discussed above , the gluonic field @xmath55 is nothing but a color chemical potential @xmath29 . \n the field @xmath13 , on the other hand , induces electric superconductivity in the ground state and , therefore , is physically more interesting . \n however , including all three gluonic fields makes the analysis quite involved . in this work , we retain only the @xmath43 field that is directly connected to the meissner masses of gluons 47 and , thus , is the most relevant field for the chromomagnetic instability . \n it is straightforward to show that the mass of the @xmath43 field at @xmath56 ( i.e. , in the 2sc / g2sc phases ) coincides with the meissner screening masses of gluons of adjoint color 47 calculated in the hard -

coupling regime @xcite ( for strong coupling , this is not the case @xcite ) . in order to determine the energetically most favored state \n , it is necessary to compare the free energies of the 2sc / g2sc phases , the neutral loff state and the gluonic phase .    to this end \n we use the following approximation derived in ref . \n @xcite for the 2sc / g2sc phases and the neutral loff state : @xmath74 where the 2sc and g2sc / loff parts of the free energy are given by    [ eq : appomega ] @xmath75 + ( q \\to -q)\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the dimensionless parameter @xmath76 being @xmath77 and @xmath78 note that the wave vector of the diquark condensate @xmath79 is equivalent to a gauge field condensate @xmath80 in the case of single plane - wave loff pairing . in eq . \n ( [ eq : appomega ] ) , the 2sc / g2sc part of the free energy is obtained by taking the @xmath81 limit . \n also a non - zero color chemical potential @xmath26 has been neglected there . \n the free energy of a given phase can be computed by solving the gap equations , e.g. , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and the neutrality condition @xmath84 . to simplify the calculations in the gluonic phase , \n we evaluate the free energy approximately as follows : ( i ) we obtain @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the 2sc / g2sc phase by solving the coupled set of equations @xmath82 and @xmath84 , ( ii ) by using these solutions , we calculate @xmath87 which is an approximate value for the free energy in the gluonic phase . for the densities of interests , @xmath43 is at most of the order of 100 mev , whereas @xmath88 is of the order of tens of mev . \n we performed a preliminary test of the quality of our approximation by varying @xmath43 from 0 to 300 mev and computing the value of @xmath89 necessary to ensure electric neutrality . \n we found that this value changes at most by 10% . \n we illustrate the comparison of the free energies of all three phases in fig . \n [ figure3 ] ( cf . \n fig .  2 in ref . \n @xcite ) . \n we take @xmath90  mev and choose the normal phase as a reference point for the free energy . in ref . \n @xcite , it has been demonstrated that the neutral loff state is more stable than the 2sc / g2sc phases in the whole loff window @xmath91 , which includes the entire g2sc window @xmath92 . \n however , \n whereas the meissner masses squared of gluons 47 in the weakly coupled neutral loff state are positive @xcite , they remain negative in the intermediate and the strongly coupled regimes ( at all values of @xmath20 above 81  mev ) @xcite . \n in contrast , the gluonic phase removes the instability and is energetically favored over the 2sc / g2sc phases in the whole window in which the instability takes place ( at all values of @xmath0 below @xmath5 ) . \n the gluonic phase and the neutral loff state coexist in the region @xmath93 , but , as our results indicate , the gluonic phase is more stable than the neutral loff state in a wide region @xmath94  mev , which is close to the edge of the g2sc window with the normal phase . \n we argue therefore that the instability in the 2sc / g2sc phase is resolved by the formation of the gluonic phase .    . \n the three dots on the bold solid line ( @xmath95  mev from left to right ) denote the edge of the g2sc window with the normal phase , the phase transition point between 2sc and g2sc phases ( @xmath96 ) , and the critical point of the chromomagnetic instability ( @xmath97 ) . \n the quark chemical potential is taken to be @xmath90  mev.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in summary , we explored the gluonic phase away from the critical point @xmath60 . \n we demonstrated that the energetically favored state of a neutral two - flavor color superconductor is not the 2sc / g2sc phase in the intermediate- and strong - coupling regimes but the gluonic phase in which the dynamic gluonic field @xmath98 acquires a vacuum expectation value . \n in particular , the whole g2sc phase is replaced by the gluonic phase which is chromomagnetically stable . \n we also compared the free energies of the 2sc / g2sc phase , the neutral loff state , and the gluonic phase . \n we found that the gluonic phase is energetically favored in the intermediate- and strong - coupling regimes . \n the encouraging results of this analysis should be further improved in the future by ( i ) taking into account the most general ansatz for the gauge - field configuration in the gluonic phase , ( ii ) by calculating the free energy in a self - consistent manner . \n we already performed a preliminary investigation including the effect of the gluon field @xmath55 , responsible for enforcing gauss law , and found that , for @xmath99 mev , the additional cost in the free energy is of order @xmath100 , and thus negligible . \n for @xmath101 mev , however , the effect of the @xmath55 field could be an order of magnitude larger . \n it is appropriate to mention that the instability related to the 8th gluon was not studied in the present work . in this sense , \n the neutral loff state is appealing , because the meissner mass of the 8th gluon is automatically zero in this state . \n it should also be mentioned that in the strongly coupled loff state @xcite the longitudinal meissner mass squared of the 8th gluon is negative . \n although this instability was not addressed in this work , it is unlikely , however , that the loff state is energetically favored in the strong -

    "we consider multilayered metamaterials comprising slightly high index inclusions ( i.e. whose permittivity is such that @xmath0 , @xmath1 is the small period to vacuum wavelength ratio ) and with low average permittivity . \n we show , by first - principles , that their optical response is driven by an unprecedented competition of first and second order spatial dispersions which are comparable due to a dramatic and non - resonant enhancement . \n such unusual competition provides various dispersion regimes supporting additional waves and topological phase transitions . \n in particular there is a novel situation where the isofrequency contour of transverse magnetic waves is bounded and disconnected . \n the proposed metamaterials are very feasible even in the optical range since , unlike high index inclusions metamaterials , they do not resort to the condition @xmath2 for enhancing second order spatial dispersion effects and can provide novel strategies for optical manipulation and steering . \n metamaterials , showing unconventional and/or tailored effective electromagnetic response , have offered a unique platform for introducing novel optical mechanisms as negative refraction , super- and hyperlensing , transformation optics , etc . @xcite . in the long - wavelength limit , metamaterial optical response is usually described through phenomenological parameters , such as effective permittivity and permeability @xcite . on the other hand , \n if the period to wavelength ratio is not very small or metal inclusions are involved , metamaterial response has an additional nonlocal contribution ( spatial dispersion ) and accordingly , nonlocal effective medium theories are in order . \n it is worth stressing that artificial electromagnetic chirality and optical magnetism , fundamental ingredients of metamaterial science , are manifestations of first and second order spatial dispersion , respectively @xcite . \n artificial electromagnetic chirality ( due to 3d , 2d and 1d geometrical chirality @xcite ) yields interesting electromagnetic phenomena as , for example , giant optical activity , asymmetric transmission , negative refractive index @xcite and repulsive casimir force @xcite . \n in addition , artificial or optical magnetism supports negative refractive index and backward - waves propagation . \n it is worth noting that second order spatial dispersion is not fully equivalent to artificial magnetism and such discrepancy has not been exploited in applied science . even though second order and \n non - magnetic nonlocalities are generally considered detrimental for several applications @xcite , they have been shown to support intriguing effects as propagation of additional waves @xcite and topological transitions @xcite . in this context , exploiting such nonlocalities is one of the challenges of metamaterial science . \n spatial dispersion is ruled by the period to wavelength ratio @xmath1 so that , unlike conventional matter , metamaterials offer a natural way for enhancing nonlocality by tailoring the meta - atoms spatial distribution . \n there are also other strategies to modify the hierarchy of the spatial dispersion orders : ( i ) by optimizing the shape and size of inclusions @xcite , ( ii ) by exploiting plasmonic resonances @xcite , ( iii ) by resorting to extreme regimes where the permittivity and/or the permeability are close to zero @xcite and ( iv ) by embedding high - index dielectric inclusions ( whose permittivity is such that @xmath2 ) @xcite . \n the latter strategy has been crucially exploited to achieve all - dielectric metamaterials ( whose response has also a magnetic contribution ) without high dissipation @xcite .    in this paper \n we propose a strategy to achieve an unusual electromagnetic response where the first and second order nonlocalities contributions are both enhanced , without resorting to plasmonic resonances , to the point that the effect of their mutual competition is comparable with the local medium response . \n such competition is very unusual in non - resonating setups since the two nonlocalities have generally different orders of magnitude and , remarkably , since their symmetry properties are different , the first and second order spatial dispersions being ruled and unaffected by geometric chirality , respectively . \n we show that this occurs in multi - layered media : @xmath3 comprising inclusions whose dielectric permittivity is such that @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the small period to vacuum wavelength ratio , ( slightly high index inclusions ) ; @xmath4 whose average permittivity is much smaller than @xmath5 . \n we analyze by first principle the ensuing and unprecedented metamaterial response and we show that transverse magnetic ( tm ) waves are ruled by a biquadratic highly tunable energy - momentum relation supporting a plethora of phenomena encompassing additional waves and topological phase transitions . \n in addition to hyperbolic , elliptic and mixed regimes , the metamaterial supports a topologically nontrivial dispersion regime characterized by bounded and multiply - connected isofrequency contours accompanied by additional waves . \n the proposed slightly high index inclusions metamaterials ( shims ) , are structurally very simple and provide a novel route to exploit spatial dispersion for steering the radiation . \n a further significant advantage of shims over high index inclusion metamaterials is that the requirement @xmath0 is much less severe than the condition @xmath2 @xcite and hence shims can be manufactured in spectral regions where extremely high permittivity media are not available , as for example , the optical range .    consider a one - dimensional multilayered medium which is periodically stratified along the @xmath6-axis and whose unit cell , of thickness @xmath7 , consists of a background dielectric matrix hosting an inclusion ( see fig.[five - regimes](a ) ) . \n the dielectric permittivity @xmath8 is @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the matrix and the inclusion , respectively . in the presence of a monochromatic electromagnetic field ( @xmath11 ) \n whose vacuum wavelength @xmath12 is larger than the stratification period , the small ratio @xmath13 rules the homogenization of the medium response . \n as defined in the introduction , a shim is characterized by the two basic requirements :    1 . \n @xmath14 , @xmath0 ; 2 . \n @xmath15 ;    ( where overline labels the average on the unit cell ) . \n we have performed a multi - scale analysis of tm waves electrodynamics ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 , see supplemental material ) in shims and we have obtained that , in the long wavelength limit @xmath18 , the leading medium response is modeled by the constitutive relations @xmath19 where @xmath20^{-1 } , \\ : \\epsilon_{\\perp } = \\overline{\\varepsilon(x ) } +   \\sum_n \\frac{a_{-n } a_{n}}{n^2 } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\kappa & = & i \\epsilon _ { || } \\sum_n \\frac{a_{-n } b_{n}}{n } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\delta & = & \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{|| } } \\left ( \\sum_n   \\frac{a_{-n } a_{n}}{n^2 } - \\kappa^2 \\right ) +   \\sum_{n , m } \\frac{a_{m } a_{-(m+n ) } b_{n}}{m(m+n)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the series are over all the integers @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the fourier coefficients of @xmath8 and @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 ) . equations ( [ response ] ) and ( [ par_eff ] ) contain the main result of this letter and they show that shims , in addition to the local response , display both first and second order spatial dispersion . using the serdyukov - fedorov transformation method \n @xcite it is straightforward proving that the obtained first order spatial dispersion is equivalent to 1d - electromagnetic chirality @xcite and that the second order spatial dispersion is non - magnetic ( i.e. there is not transformation yielding a non - vanishing magnetic permeability ) . \n it is essential here stressing that eqs.([response ] ) does not contain @xmath1 and this physically yields an unprecedented regime where local response and nonlocalities mutually compete on the same footing . note that in media with shallow dielectric modulation spatial dispersion contributions are too weak to appear in the leading order term of the effective response ( they are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ) @xcite . \n the shim requirements ( i ) and ( ii ) forbid resonances that would produce a dominant local response and at the same time they trigger a peculiar nonlocality enhancement which differently raises the standard first and second order spatial dispersions contributions , whereas higher order spatial dispersion contributions are still weak . in order to discuss this point , \n let us first analyze its local component . \n due to the shim requirement @xmath3 , the average of @xmath29 is dominated by the background contribution @xmath9 so that @xmath30 ( see the first of eqs.([par_eff ] ) ) . \n this is a key point characterizing shims since , in the presence of a uniformly large dielectric spatial modulation , @xmath31 is so large to yield superlensing @xcite which is unaffected by spatial dispersion . \n the shim requirement @xmath4 , achievable by suitably tailoring the inclusion dielectric profile ( see below ) , states that first contribution @xmath32 to @xmath33 in the second of eqs.([par_eff ] ) is not large . on the other hand , the fourier coefficients of @xmath8 ( with @xmath34 ) \n are @xmath23 with @xmath35 as a consequence of the shim requirement @xmath3 and hence @xmath36 . in other words , even if the dielectric modulation is large , a shim has effective permittivities which are not so large to suppress the effect of spatial dispersion . \n let us analyze now the nonlocal response . \n the shim requirement @xmath3 implies that all the fourier coefficients of @xmath37 are dominated by the permittivity of the background and hence @xmath38 . as a consequence , from the third and fourth of eqs.([par_eff ] ) , the whole shim nonlocal response is as strong as the local component . \n such a peculiar spatial dispersion enhancement can heuristically be grasped from the effective medium response of a layered medium with shallow ( s ) dielectric modulation reported in ref.@xcite . \n the constitutive relations of that case for tm waves coincide with eqs.([response ] ) without the second order spatial dispersion contribution and with electromagnetic parameters @xmath39^{-1}$ ] , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the fourier coefficients of @xmath8 and @xmath44 . \n spatial dispersion in this situation is weak since @xmath45 and this is due to the low dielectric contrast . \n the crucial point here is that if we replace @xmath46 and @xmath47 in @xmath48 the expression of @xmath49 of eqs.([par_eff ] ) is fully recovered so that we can state that shim mechanism is literally able to haul first order spatial dispersion from the @xmath1 order to the leading one . \n generalizing , this observation also sheds light on the shim enhancement of the second order spatial dispersion which , in a low dielectric contrast medium , is very weak ( @xmath28 ) with contributions containing either two @xmath42 or two @xmath43 terms . \n the above shim mechanism of raising only @xmath50 ( for @xmath34 ) thus efficiently boosts the contributions containing two @xmath42 terms and this explains their appearance in eqs.([par_eff ] ) . \n we conclude that the specific shim structure ( see requirements ( i ) and ( ii ) ) crucially modifies the spatial dispersion orders hierarchy to the point of triggering an unprecedented overall competition between first and second order contribution which are as strong as the local optical response .     and @xmath10 are the matrix and the inclusion permettivities , respectively . \n ( b)-(f ) isofrequency contours corresponding to the topologically different dispersion regimes supported by a shim.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to discuss the physical consequences of the strong shim nonlocal response , we analyze here the energy - momentum relation of tm waves @xmath51 , propagating in a lossless structure , which is @xmath52 \n the first remarkable consequence of second order spatial dispersion ( represented by @xmath53 ) is that such equation is biquadratic . \n the above discussed competition between local response and nonlocalities implies that , in principle , every possible regime provided by eq.([disp2 ] ) can be achieved since the four coefficients in eqs.([disp2 ] ) depend on the four independent effective shim parameters which , in turn , are mutually comparable .    ) in the elliptic - like ii regime . \n ( b ) comparison among the isofrequency contours predicted by shim theory ( dashed lines ) and the photonic crystal description ( bloch modes ) and the result of the full wave simulation ( circles ) performed at normal -

regimes ] we have sketched ( a ) the geometry of the stratified shim together with all the possible and topologically different isofrequency contours supported by eq.([disp2 ] ) whose associated five different regimes are : ( b ) hyperbolic - like i , ( c ) hyperbolic - like ii , ( d ) mixed , ( e ) elliptic - like i and ( f ) elliptic - like ii . it is remarkable that the class of shim metamaterials is able to support such a variety of regimes comprising both bounded ( e and f ) and unbounded ( b , c and d ) propagating wave spectra whose isofrequency contours \n can both be connected ( e ) and disconnected ( b , c , d and f ) . the mixed regime of fig.[five - regimes](d ) \n is characterized by an isofrequency contour showing elliptic - like and hyperbolic - like components @xcite . \n the elliptic - like ii regime of fig.[five - regimes](f ) has never been predicted , to the best of our knowledge , in one - dimensional metamaterials and it is main remarkable feature is that , within the allowed @xmath56 spectral region , there are two forward tm propagating waves with the same transverse momentum , i.e. additional waves occur .    in order to check the accuracy of the shim effective response of eqs.([response ] ) we compare its predictions with the full electromagnetic theory , both analytical ( bloch analysis of 1d photonic crystals ) and numerical ( 2d full - wave simulation @xcite ) . as a benchmark example to discuss the shim feasibility , \n we consider a periodically stratified structure whose unit cell comprises three homogeneous slabs , two of which ( @xmath57,@xmath58 ) represent the inclusion and the third ( @xmath59 ) describes the background . \n we consider a situation where the period to wavelength ratio is @xmath60 and we choose @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 with filling fractions @xmath64 and @xmath65 . \n such a material design meets the shim requirements since @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . \n the situation belongs to the elliptic - like ii regime of fig.[five - regimes](f ) where additional waves are expected as sketched in fig.[comparison](a ) . for this particular shim , we have numerically evaluated @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 from eqs.([par_eff ] ) . in fig.[comparison](b ) , we compare the isofrequency contour from eqs.([disp2 ] ) with the standard transfer matrix approach which provides the quasi - momentum @xmath73 of the bloch modes . \n the agreement of the above discussed shim response with full electromagnetic theory is particularly evident together with the occurrence of additional waves . \n note also that @xmath74 and @xmath75^{-1 } = -1 $ ] so that the standard effective medium theory predicts that plane waves propagation is forbidden in the considered medium , in striking contrast with the common result of our shim theory and of full electromagnetic analysis . \n it is worth stressing that such spatial dispersion dominated regime is achieved by means of relatively small values of the layers permittivities as compared to those pertaining high index inclusion metamaterials @xcite . due to the relevance and the novelty of such regime \n , we have analyzed through full wave simulations the excitation of the additional waves inside a slab of thickness @xmath76 @xmath77 m and filled by the above considered shim with period @xmath78 @xmath77 m . the slab is illuminated by a monochromatic plane wave with wavelength @xmath79 @xmath77 m and normally impinging onto the facet @xmath80 , as sketched in fig.[comparison](a ) . in fig.[comparison](c ) , we plot @xmath81 along the slab thickness and its profile reveals the occurrence of different spatial harmonics . in fig.[comparison](d ) we report the modulus of the fourier spectrum of @xmath81 which displays four distinct peaks corresponding to two forward and two backward propagating waves thus proving the possibility to excite additional waves in finite - thick slab . for completeness , in fig.[comparison](b ) we have superimposed to the above isofrequency contours the four waves numbers @xmath82 ( circles ) which coincide with those predicted by the above description of an unbounded shim .     to @xmath83 . \n shim dispersion at the vacuum wavelength @xmath84 shows a wave - vector degeneracy at @xmath85 and an associated dirac point . \n , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the existence of various different dispersion regimes implies that shims also host unusual topological transitions . as an example we consider a three - layer structure whose \n layers are filled with silver ag ( 1 playing the role of the inclusion ) , silicon oxide sio@xmath86 ( 2 ) and air ( 3 ) , with filling fractions @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . \n we have modelled the ag dielectric response with the drude permittivity @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 , @xmath92 s@xmath93 , \n @xmath94 s@xmath93 @xcite ) , and we have assumed for the sio@xmath86 permittivity @xmath95 an empirical sellmeier equation @xcite . \n we have evaluated the isofrequency contours for various vacuum wavelength both using the above shim response and the bloch theory and compared them with the isofrequency contours obtained from the standard homogenization theory of layered media @xcite . in fig.[transitions ] we plot @xmath96 and @xmath97 as functions of @xmath56 ( real ) at the three wavelengths @xmath98 . \n the agreement between shim and bloch theory is remarkable at any wavelength whereas the standard theory is not adequate since it reproduces a portion around @xmath54 of a single connected component of the correct isofrequency contours . at @xmath99 \n the shim is in the hyperbolic - like i regime since the lower and upper branches of figs.[transitions](a ) and ( b ) are of pure dissipative origin . on the other hand at @xmath83 ( figs.[transitions](e ) and ( f ) ) , \n the shim is in the mixed regime and this proves that a topological transition between the two regimes . \n it is remarkable that the such transition is accompanied by an intermediate state at @xmath84 ( see figs.[transitions](c ) and ( d ) ) where the two dispersion branches of the mixed regime merge at @xmath54 thus producing a wave - vector degeneracy and an associated dirac point .    in conclusion \n , we have introduced a class of 1d metamaterials ( shims ) supporting a peculiar electrodynamic behavior driven by optical nonlocalities . in comparison with other spatial dispersion enhancement strategies , since the inclusion permittivity is slightly high ( as defined above ) , our method for tailoring the shim response is not severely hampered by the lack of materials with very high dielectric permittivity . \n the shim structure triggers a novel physical mechanism boosting at the same time both electromagnetic chirality and second order nonlocality to the point of achieving their competition , in striking contrast to essentially all the other situation hitherto investigated . \n the dominant role played by spatial dispersion in shim leads to a variety of different electromagnetic regimes supporting exotic phenomena such as topological phase transitions an transverse magnetic additional waves . due to the their feasibility and to the variety of topologically different regimes \n they host , we believe that shims and their extension to higher dimensional structures could play a pivotal role for conceiving a novel class of metamaterials and radiation steering devices where optical nonlocality is fully exploited even in the optical range .",

    "deriving the physical properties of red supergiants ( rsgs ) depends upon accurate corrections for reddening by dust . \n we use our recent modeling of the optical spectra of rsgs to address this topic . \n first , we find that previous broad - band studies have underestimated the correction for extinction in the visible , and hence the luminosities ( if derived from @xmath0 ) ; the shift in the effective wavelengths of the standard @xmath1 and @xmath0 bandpasses necessitates using an _ effective _ value of the ratio @xmath2 to correct broad - band photometry of rsgs if @xmath3 for early - type stars viewed through the same dust , where we have assumed the standard reddening law of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) . \n use of the fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) reddening law would lead to @xmath4 , as well as slightly lower values of extinction derived from spectrophotometry , but results in slightly poorer fits . \n second , we find that a significant fraction of rsgs in galactic ob associations and clusters show up to several magnitudes of excess visual extinction compared to ob stars in the same regions ; we argue that this is likely due to circumstellar dust around the rsgs . \n we also show that the rsg dust production rate ( as indicated by the 12-@xmath5 m excess ) is well - correlated with bolometric luminosity , contrary to what has been found by earlier studies . \n the stars with the highest amount of extra visual extinction also show significant near - uv ( nuv ) excesses compared to the stellar models reddened by the standard reddening law . \n this nuv excess is likely due to scattering of the star s light by the dust and/or a larger average grain size than that typical of grains found in the diffuse interstellar medium . \n similar excesses have been attributed to circumstellar dust around r coronae borealis stars . \n finally , we estimate that the rsgs contribute dust grains at the rate of @xmath6 yr@xmath7 kpc@xmath8 in the solar neighborhood , comparable to what we estimate for late - type wcs , @xmath9 yr@xmath7 kpc@xmath8 . in the solar neighborhood \n this represents only a few percent of the dust production ( which is dominated by low - mass agbs ) , but we note that in low - metallicity starbursts , dust production by rsgs would likely dominate over other sources .",

    "transport phenomena on a quantum scale appear in a variety of systems , ranging from photosynthetic complexes to engineered quantum devices . \n it has been predicted that the efficiency of quantum transport can be enhanced through dynamic interaction between the system and a noisy environment . \n we report the first experimental demonstration of such environment - assisted quantum transport , using an engineered network of laser - written waveguides , with relative energies and inter - waveguide couplings tailored to yield the desired hamiltonian . \n controllable decoherence is simulated via broadening the bandwidth of the input illumination , yielding a significant increase in transport efficiency relative to the narrowband case . \n we show integrated optics to be suitable for simulating specific target hamiltonians as well as open quantum systems with controllable loss and decoherence . \n recent research into photosynthetic antenna complexes has shown evidence of coherence in excitonic energy transport  @xcite , despite the noisy cellular environment in which such complexes are found . \n indeed , environmental decoherence has been credited with increasing the efficiency of transport through these systems , an effect known as environment - assisted quantum transport ( enaqt )  @xcite or dephasing - assisted transport  @xcite . while enaqt has been the subject of many theoretical studies  whether in the photosynthetic context  @xcite or in other nanoscale transport systems  @xcite  and despite its potential for improving transport in artificial quantum systems , it has so far never been directly observed . \n we use an integrated photonic simulator to demonstrate the first implementation of enaqt . \n our simulator was fabricated using femtosecond - laser direct writing , which allows waveguides to be drawn directly into glass using a focused pulsed laser . \n this permits the creation of three - dimensional waveguide arrays , as well as precision and repeatability in engineering interactions  @xcite . \n we used control over the wavelength and bandwidth of the guided light to simulate effective decoherence , thereby enhancing transport efficiency . \n we consider a single excitation on a network of @xmath0 coupled sites , governed by a tight - binding hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the excitation being localised at site @xmath3 , @xmath4 the energy of that site , and @xmath5 the coupling between sites @xmath3 and @xmath6 . \n although enaqt can occur on an ordered lattice where all the energies @xmath4 are equal  @xcite , transport enhancement was first explained in disordered systems , which we consider here . \n we are interested in the efficiency of transport from a particular initial site to a particular target site , where the excitation is trapped . in the case of a photosynthetic complex ( figure  [ fig : enaqt]a ) \n , trapping describes the transfer of excitons to a reaction center , where they drive charge separation . \n it can be modelled as irreversible coupling of the target site to a sink at rate @xmath7 ( figure  [ fig : enaqt]b ) . \n the efficiency is then the probability of finding the exciton in the sink after some particular time . \n enaqt occurs when decoherence increases the trapping probability over the fully coherent case . \n decoherence results from coupling of a quantum system to inaccessible degrees of freedom . \n for example , in photosynthetic antenna complexes , the energies of chromophores are coupled to molecular vibrations ; tracing out this environment results in decoherence in the excitonic subspace .    in the absence of decoherence \n , energetic disorder tends to localise the wavepacket through processes such as destructive interference or anderson localisation  @xcite , thus preventing it from reaching the target . \n since these are coherent processes , they are diminished by decoherence , possibly resulting in enhancement of transport efficiency to the target site . \n an alternative but ultimately equivalent view of enaqt is that eigenstates of @xmath8 are stationary , making it difficult to reach the target if the initial and target sites differ in energy . \n incoherent processes , however , permit transitions between the eigenstates of @xmath8 , yielding greater mobility .    the first theoretical explorations of enaqt focused on the case where the decoherence takes the form of site - independent , markovian , pure dephasing  @xcite . \n although the decoherence in our simulation is neither site - based nor markovian , this is not an obstacle to enaqt ;  @xcite transport efficiency can be enhanced as long as the decoherence allows population transfer between otherwise - stationary eigenstates . \n we simulate enaqt in an array of coupled single - mode optical waveguides obeying the equation  @xcite @xmath9 where the light is propagating in the @xmath10-direction , @xmath11 is a creation operator for a photon in waveguide @xmath3 at position @xmath10 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively the propagation constants of the waveguides and the couplings between them . \n the former are determined by the waveguides refractive index profiles , while the latter also depend on the separations between them . \n light propagation governed by this schrdinger - like equation directly simulates evolution under @xmath8 , with @xmath13 replacing @xmath5 and the @xmath12 replacing @xmath4 . \n we can thus simulate different hamiltonians by controlling the number , position , and refractive indices of the waveguides . \n the intrinsic stability of laser - written waveguide arrays renders decoherence challenging to simulate . \n one approach is to stochastically modulate the index of refraction along each waveguide  @xcite . \n though every realization with a particular longitudinal index profile will be fully coherent , decoherence can be simulated by averaging over the recorded optical outputs from many realizations in post - processing . \n this approach was recently used to simulate decoherence - enhanced navigation of a maze  @xcite .    by contrast , we simulate decoherence by averaging over the results from a single array illuminated with many optical wavelengths . \n although each individual wavelength propagates through the waveguide array coherently , decoherence can be achieved using broadband illumination and a single output intensity measurement which does not resolve wavelength . in other words , the wavelength degree of freedom \n is traced out yielding a partially mixed state . \n similar approaches are well established in optics , where for instance thick birefringent quartz plates followed by wavelength - insensitive measurements have been used to decohere the polarization states of single photons  @xcite .        as an example of our approach to simulating decoherence \n , we consider two uncoupled waveguides @xmath14 and @xmath15 that have a difference @xmath16 in their propagation constants at a wavelength @xmath17 . as light propagates along the waveguides \n , it will accumulate a phase difference @xmath18 between them . \n broadband illumination can then be seen to cause effective decoherence on a length scale comparable to the illumination coherence length : any initial coherence @xmath19 between the waveguides will decay : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the normalised first - order temporal correlation function of the light , which  being proportional to the fourier transform of the spectrum \n decays to zero faster for spectrally broader illumination . \n the strength @xmath22 of the decoherence can be quantified as the inverse of the optical coherence length , @xmath23 , and is usually proportional to the fwhm bandwidth @xmath24 . for a uniform distribution centered at @xmath17 , @xmath25    in the case of coupled waveguides \n , wavelength dependence affects couplings in addition to the propagation constants . \n the resulting decoherence will therefore not only have characteristics of pure dephasing ( as in equation  ) , but will also include off - diagonal terms . \n however , this kind of decoherence can also result in enaqt . \n indeed , the off - diagonal terms imply that our decoherence could , in principle , be used to simulate enaqt in ordered systems  @xcite , but the effect would be weaker because of the absence of the pure - dephasing contribution .    for our simulation we chose a network of four waveguide sites  arranged as in figure  [ fig : enaqt]c  because it is one of the smallest systems in which enaqt is possible and because it can give significant enhancements even with relatively weak decoherence . \n waveguide 1 was the input , waveguide 3 the target , and the sink consisted of a long linear array of tightly coupled waveguides . \n the coupling between waveguides in this sink was significantly higher than between the four main waveguides , so that any light entering the sink from waveguide 3 was largely transported away  @xcite . \n the sink need only be long enough to prevent light reflected from the far end from returning into the main simulation waveguides . \n we need to choose propagation constants and separations among the four main waveguides in order to best approximate this hamiltonian : @xmath26 where all parameters depend on the wavelength @xmath27 of the input light . due to their wide separations , \n couplings between non - neighbouring sites are negligible ( @xmath28 of neighbouring - site couplings ) . \n our simulator is designed so that , at our central simulation wavelength @xmath17 , @xmath29 in this case , one of the eigenstates of @xmath8 has no support on site 3 , @xmath30 , while the remaining three eigenstates all have substantial support on site 3 . \n because @xmath31 can not couple to the sink  at least at @xmath17the maximum trapping efficiency at infinite time is @xmath32 .    considering the wavelength dependence of @xmath8 \n provides a different way to see the decohering effects of broadband illumination . due to \n the dependence of @xmath33 and @xmath34 on the wavelength , equation   only holds at a particular wavelength @xmath17 . at other wavelengths \n , @xmath31 will have some support on waveguide 3 and thus be able to couple to the sink , increasing the efficiency above @xmath35 , as shown in figure  [ fig : enaqt]d . \n unlike in other examples of enaqt  @xcite , the efficiency increases monotonically with the strength of decoherence , meaning there is no optimal level of decoherence in this model .    based on measurements of couplings and propagation constants in isolated pairs of waveguides ( see methods ) \n , we selected the following design parameters : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ( see figure  [ fig : enaqt]c ) . figure  [ fig : setup]a shows numerical modelling of light propagation given these parameters . although these were designed for a center wavelength of 800  nm , variations in the implementation of the waveguide parameters resulted in equation  [ eqn : condition ] being satisfied at @xmath39  nm .    we measured the efficiency using narrowband light ( less than 1  nm bandwidth and always horizontally polarised for consistency ) from a tuneable ti : sapphire laser ( spectra - physics tsunami ) in quasi - cw mode ( figure  [ fig : setup]b ) . \n the output was imaged using a custom - built @xmath40 magnifying telescope and the optical power was measured using a large - area power -

hat distribution on @xmath43 . as predicted \n , it is an increasing function of the bandwidth , i.e. , of the decoherence strength @xmath22 . \n the highest enaqt observed was @xmath44 at a bandwidth of @xmath45  nm . \n we thus demonstrated that coherent transport in a coupled , statically disordered system can be enhanced through decoherence .    the theoretical prediction in figure  [ fig : results]b contains no free parameters . it is a simulation of the dynamics under the simulated hamiltonian @xmath8 , together with trapping from site 3 at the rate @xmath7 discussed in methods and pure dephasing between waveguide @xmath46 and the other three waveguides at rate @xmath22 . \n the disagreement between theory and experiment is small considering the number of possible contributing factors . \n these include the off - diagonal decoherence when the waveguides are coupled , the fact that the trapping is not perfectly exponential , errors in the measurements of the coupling constants , optical losses , and error in satisfying equation  [ eqn : condition ] . as an example , the shaded band in figure  [ fig : results]b represents the error that would arise if @xmath47 deviated from @xmath48 by up to 10% .    in our experiment , \n the magnitude of enaqt was limited by the maximum achievable decoherence , which at @xmath49  @xmath50 was small compared to the inverse of the propagation length . \n we were limited by two components of equation : the tunability of our laser limited @xmath24 , while @xmath51 was limited ( via equation ) by the need to keep @xmath34 small enough to stay in the tight - binding approximation . \n these are not fundamental limitations , and future improvements that increase @xmath22 would result in significantly larger transport enhancement ; as shown in figure  [ fig : enaqt]d , the transport efficiency of this model can get arbitrarily close to 1 for sufficiently long propagation distances and decoherence strengths . \n stronger decoherence would also allow enaqt to be observed in networks that are less sensitive to decoherence than our model . \n our results demonstrate that integrated photonics are well - suited for simulating open quantum systems , capable of implementing a disordered target hamiltonian with controllable loss . \n the technique of using broadband excitation to introduce tuneable levels of decoherence ensures that photonics can simulate open quantum systems ; previously , low intrinsic noise in photonic devices rendered decoherence difficult to realize in integrated optics , particularly without averaging over results from many different device realizations . \n our approach will not only improve the controllability of photonic quantum simulation , but also aid in the experimental optimisation of transport in other engineered quantum systems .",

    "topological landscape is introduced for networks with functions defined on the nodes . by extending the notion of gradient flows to the network setting , critical nodes of different indices are defined . \n this leads to a concise and hierarchical representation of the network . \n persistent homology from computational topology is used to design efficient algorithms for performing such analysis . \n applications to some examples in social and biological networks are demonstrated , which show that critical nodes carry important information about structures and dynamics of such networks . \n networks have become ubiquitous tools for describing structures that occur in a variety of fields in the past ten or fifteen years , including biology , social sciences , economics and engineering . to study a network \n , one has to endow it with some mathematical structure . \n the simplest mathematical structure on a network is the graph structure . \n this gives rise to notions such as degrees , paths , connectivity , etc . \n the distinctions between scale - free networks and small - world networks , for example , can be studied by examining this structure , see for example @xcite . \n but one can endow a network with more sophisticated structures , such as geometric structure as in the theory of manifold learning , @xcite , or topological structure as in the theory of persistent homology @xcite . \n these structures allow us to probe more deeply into the nature of the network .    in this paper \n , we discuss how one can endow a network with a _ \n landscape _ when we study a function on the node set . \n the concept of landscape has been crucial in physics and chemistry in describing complex systems , such as energy landscape @xcite . \n the introduction of such a concept into complex networks may equip us with a concise description of global structures of networks and help explain certain dynamics such as information diffusion and transition pathways . \n many complex networks in real world carry flows of information , products , power , etc . \n , which are driven by local gradients of a scalar or energy @xcite . \n for example traffic flows may be driven by congestion function , heat flows are driven by temperature . in biomolecular folding , \n conformational changes are driven by the free energy of states . on internet , \n user s attention may be driven by the centrality or significance of websites such as pagerank . in these cases , communities or groups \n emerge as metastable sets of gradient - based dynamics or energy basins . \n therefore understanding the landscape of such functions will be crucial to disclose associated dynamics in complex networks . in the core of the landscape \n lies the notion of critical nodes . in continuous \n setting this meets the classical morse theory in the study of manifolds @xcite , where critical points can be located by vanishing gradients and their indices can be decided by dimensionality of the unstable manifold passing through . \n however such an approach can not be applied to the graph settings as there is no unambiguous definition of dimensionality in general . \n precisely , consider an undirected graph @xmath0 with a function defined on the node set @xmath1 . \n the question we will attempt to address is : _ given a function on its nodes , how can we endow the network with a landscape , so that one can distinguish critical nodes such as the local minima , local maxima , and saddles _ ? \n there are several studies in the literature which may lead to critical nodes for graphs by carrying morse theory to discrete settings . \n nevertheless , none of them gives a satisfied answer to the question . in computational geometry \n one may embed the graph into a 2d - surface and then apply morse theory for 2-manifolds @xcite . \n however , such a surface embedding is not natural for general graphs in biological and social networks . \n another candidate is discrete morse theory @xcite , which studies functions defined on all faces of cell complexes and is therefore hard to use in the graph setting above . \n a related subject is the extension of the poincare - hopf theorem to the graph setting , e.g. in @xcite . in this paper \n we present a purely combinatorial approach which starts from a discrete gradient flow induced by the function on graph nodes . \n such an approach does not need a surface embedding , and turns out to be closely related to persistent homology in computational topology @xcite and discrete morse theory @xcite without studying functions on high dimensional cells . \n in particular , given a function ( often referred to as an energy function ) on a network , we will define a discrete gradient flow associated with that function , as well as minimum energy paths between two disjoint sets of nodes . \n this allows us to define critical nodes or saddles . roughly speaking , critical nodes \n are associated with minimum energy paths between node pairs : index-@xmath2 critical nodes are simply local minima ; index-@xmath3 critical nodes are the highest energy transition nodes of minimal energy paths connecting index-@xmath4 critical nodes . \n such a critical node analysis , as we show by examples in social networks and biological networks , leads to a concise representation of networks while preserving some important structural properties . in short \n , the local minima or maxima together with their attraction basins can be interpreted as communities or groups in networks ; saddle points act as transition states between different critical points of lower indices . in particular , in social networks index-1 saddles act as hubs in connecting communities ; in biomolecular dynamics , index-1 saddles play roles as intermediate or transition states connecting misfolded and native states . in the latter , \n such an analysis does not rely on commonly used markov state model , whence can be applied to much more general data analysis . \n moreover , this approach leads to a hierarchical classification of nodes in the network and a global visualization of networks adaptive to the landscape of given energy function .    in algorithmic aspect , critical nodes in this paper \n can be computed at a polynomial time cost with an algorithm based on computational topology by monitoring topological changes over energy evel sets , and in nondegenerate case an almost linear algorithm exists which is scalable for the analysis of large scale networks .",

    "while following up l dwarf candidates selected photometrically from the two micron all sky survey , we uncovered an unusual object designated 2mass j01415823@xmath04633574 . \n its optical spectrum exhibits very strong bands of vanadium oxide but abnormally weak absorptions by titanium oxide , potassium , and sodium . \n morphologically such spectroscopic characteristics fall intermediate between old , field early - l dwarfs ( @xmath1 ) and very late m giants ( @xmath2 ) , leading us to favor low gravity as the explanation for the unique spectral signatures of this l dwarf . \n such a low gravity can be explained only if this l dwarf is much lower in mass than a typical old field l dwarf of similar temperature and is still contracting to its final radius . \n these conditions imply a very young age . \n further evidence of youth is found in the near - infrared spectrum , including a triangular - shaped h - band continuum reminiscent of young brown dwarf candidates discovered in the orion nebula cluster . using the above information along with comparisons to brown dwarf atmospheric and interior models , \n our current best estimate is that this l dwarf has an age of 1 - 50 myr and a mass of 6 - 25 @xmath3 . \n although the lack of a lithium detection ( pseudo equivalent width @xmath41  ) might appear to contradict other evidence of youth , we suggest that lithium becomes weaker at lower gravity like all other alkali lines and thus needs to be carefully considered before being used as a diagnostic of age or mass for objects in this regime . \n the location of 2mass 0141@xmath04633 on the sky coupled with a distance estimate of @xmath535 pc and the above age estimate suggests that this object may be a brown dwarf member of either the 30-myr - old tucana / horologium association or the @xmath512-myr - old @xmath6 pic moving group . \n distance as determined through trigonometric parallax ( underway ) and a measure of the total space motion are needed to test this hypothesis .",

spin evolution @xmath70 to find out how to control the decoherence , we neglect for the time being the diagonal nuclear spin interaction @xmath53 , which contributes to the same component of the pseudo - magnetic field as @xmath71 but much smaller . because the pseudo - fields dominated by the extrinsic nuclear spin interaction , @xmath72 , invert exactly into each other , disentanglement of the electron spin from the affected bath spin pairs follows at @xmath73 as in the classic spin echo to remove the inhomogeneous broadening effect . \n the pseudo - fields dominated by the intrinsic interaction , @xmath74 , do not exactly invert under the influence of the electron spin flip and the resultant pseudospin trajectories are illustrated in fig . \n [ fig1](a ) . \n disentanglement from the affected nuclear pairs and , hence , recovery of the electron spin coherence occurs , by the rotation kinematics , at time @xmath75 , distinct from the classic echo . \n fig . \n [ fig1](b , c ) give the computed results for the electron spin coherence in a dot of @xmath76 nuclear spins in gaas which reveals the coherence recovery after a flip of the electron spin at a range of values for @xmath77 , even after the coherence has apparently vanished . \n furthermore , the coherence may be restored by a sequence of electron spin flips . \n for example , with a sequence of @xmath68-pulses evenly spaced with interval @xmath77 , the disentanglement from the bath will occur at @xmath78 between the @xmath31th and the @xmath79th pulses , as illustrated in fig . \n [ fig1](d ) . consider the correction from the small term @xmath53 in the pseudo - fields , the residue decoherence , at the disentanglement point @xmath80 , is measured by @xmath81 . \n compared to the free - induction decay @xcite where @xmath82 , the decoherence is reduced by a factor of @xmath83 ( @xmath84 for @xmath85s ) . \n ensemble average over the mixed bath states is necessary in two scenarios , namely , observation of decoherence of an ensemble of quantum objects and observation of a single quantum object repeated in a time sequence  @xcite . \n the coherence of the electron spin is now @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the inhomogeneous broadening factor due to the probability distribution @xmath33 of the initial bath state @xmath34 ( different nuclear bath state may result in different overhauser energy - splitting @xmath88 of the electron ) @xcite . \n @xmath89 $ ] under the control of a sequence of @xmath68-rotations on electron spin at @xmath90 and @xmath91 . \n the coherence factor @xmath92 is insensitive , up to a factor of @xmath93 , to the selection of initial bath state @xmath94 ( verified by numerical evaluations ) , and is taken out of the summation @xcite . \n both the inhomogeneous broadening and the pure decoherence due to the extrinsic bath spin interaction are shown to be removed at the classic spin echo time @xmath95 in contrast to the unusual recovery time of @xmath96 in the case of intrinsic bath spin interaction . \n we need a pulse sequence to produce a time where the decoherence from all three sources can be removed . \n a solution is a two - pulse control . \n fig . \n [ fig2](a ) shows that , after a second electron spin flip at @xmath97 , the paths of the two pseudospin states corresponding to the electron @xmath18 states driven by the intrinsic nuclear spin pair interaction cross again at @xmath98 , coinciding with the secondary spin echo time for the other two causes . \n this two pulse sequence is well - known as carr - purcell sequence in nmr spectroscopies @xcite . \n the residual decoherence at @xmath99 is @xmath100 . \n the restoration by two - pulse control of coherence in the presence of both pure and ensemble decoherence is demonstrated by the results of numerical evaluation shown in fig . \n [ fig2](b , c ) . \n the electron spin coherence is restored at @xmath101 by the second pulse even when the first spin - echo at @xmath95 has completely vanished , illustrating the remarkable observation @xcite that the absence of spin echo does not mean irreversible loss of coherence . \n the power of concatenation of pulse sequences has been shown in the context of dynamical decoupling in quantum computation @xcite . \n similarly , the control of disentanglement of the bath states from the quantum object may be enhanced by concatenation . the pseudo - spin evolution with the two - pulse control of the quantum object \n can be constructed recursively from the free - induction evolution @xmath102 , by the concatenation , @xmath103 , @xmath104 . \n the process can be extended by iteration , fig . \n [ fig2](d ) , to any level , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the rotation vector along the axis of rotation through an angle @xmath107 . \n disentanglement occurs at @xmath108 coinciding with the classic spin echo . for small @xmath107 , \n the recursion relation is @xmath109 . at each iteration , \n the rotation vectors of the conjugate pseudo - spin states have their mean @xmath110 increased by a factor of @xmath111 and their difference @xmath112 reduced by a factor of @xmath113 ( deduced by induction from @xmath114 ) . \n the decoherence is reduced by an order of @xmath115 at @xmath116 for each additional level of concatenation till saturation at the level @xmath117 . \n hence , the coherence echo magnitude scales with the echo delay time according to @xmath118 as shown in fig . \n [ fig2](e ) . \n our result shows the protection of electron spin coherence by pulse sequences with interpulse interval up to @xmath119s    in conclusion , we note that our scheme of restoring the coherence depends on the pure decoherence being driven by the interaction in the spin bath and by the domination of the bath pair excitation in the slow bath dynamics . \n the pulse sequence design is borrowed from the dynamical decoupling schemes in nmr spectroscopies @xcite and in quantum computation @xcite but the disentanglement method aims directly at the bath dynamics . \n our method seeks not to eliminate the object - bath interaction by dynamical averaging , but to disentangle by controlling the quantum object to maneuver the bath evolution . \n thus , elimination of coupling between the quantum object and the bath is not a necessary condition for their disentanglement , as illustrated by coherence recovery at @xmath120 where effective object - bath interaction does not vanish even in the first order of hyperfine coupling @xmath121 . \n direct observation of coherence echoes at such magic times is possible with the narrowing of inhomogeneous distribution by measurement projection @xcite . \n the control of bath spins may well develop into a valuable addition to the collection of armaments of coherence preservation for quantum information processing . \n we acknowledge support from nsf dmr-0403465 , aro / lps , and darpa / afosr .    26    natexlab#1#1bibnamefont # 1#1bibfnamefont # 1#1citenamefont # 1#1url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2]#2 [ 2][]#2    , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , _ _ ( , , ) , ed .    , * * , ( ) .    , \n * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) \n ; , * * , ( ) ; , , , * * , ( ) .    , _ _ ( , , ) .    , , , * * , ( ) .    , _ _ ( , , ) , ed .    , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , ( ) .    , , , , , \n * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , * * , ( ) . \n the orbital wavefunction of the electron covers all @xmath0 nuclei , so the contact hyperfine coupling with each nuclear spin is @xmath121 , inverse proportional to the bath size @xmath0 .    , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , , , , \n * * , ( ) .    , , , * * , ( ) . \n , , , , , ( ) ; , , , * * , ( ) ; , , , , * * , ( ) . \n * supplementary information for `` restoring coherence lost to a slow interacting mesoscopic bath '' *",

floor domain in the laplacian channel . \n an example of the @xmath2 ldpc code with four iterations ( each iteration consisting of two semi - steps : from bits - to - checks and from checks - to - bits ) of the min - sum decoding is discussed . a generalized computational tree analysis is devised to explain the rational structure of the leading instantons . \n the asymptotic for the symbol bit - error - rate in the error - floor domain is comprised of individual instanton contributions , each estimated as @xmath3 , where the effective distances , @xmath4 , of the the leading instantons are @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively . \n ( the hamming distance of the code is @xmath7 . ) \n the analysis shows that the instantons are distinctly different from the ones found for the same coding / decoding scheme performing over the gaussian channel . \n we validate instanton results against direct simulations and offer an explanation for remarkable performance of the instanton approximation not only in the extremal , @xmath8 , limit but also at the moderate @xmath0 values of practical interest . \n a novel exciting era has begun in coding theory with the discovery of low - density - parity - check ( ldpc ) @xcite and turbo @xcite codes . \n these codes are special , not only because they can approach the virtually error - free transmission limit , but mainly because a computationally efficient iterative decoding scheme is readily available . when operating at moderate noise values these approximate decoding algorithms show an unprecedented ability to correct errors , a remarkable feature that has attracted a lot of attention @xcite . \n however , it was also shown that the approximate algorithms are incapable of matching the performance of maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding beyond the so - called error - floor threshold found at higher signal - to - noise - ratios ( snr ) . \n the importance of error - floor , i.e. highest snr , analysis was recognized in the early stages of the turbo code revolution @xcite , and it soon became apparent that ldpc codes are also not immune to the error - floor deficiency @xcite . to estimate the error - floor asymptotics in modern high - quality systems is a notoriously difficult task because direct numerical methods , e.g.  monte carlo , can not be used to determine bit - error - rate ( ber ) below @xmath9 . \n the main approaches to the error - floor analysis problem proposed to date include : ( i ) a heuristic approach of the importance sampling type @xcite , utilizing theoretical considerations developed for a typical randomly constructed ldpc code performing over the binary - erasure channel @xcite , and ( ii ) deriving lower bounds for ber @xcite .    recently \n , we ( in collaboration with v.  chernyak and b.  vasic ) have also proposed a physics inspired approach that is capable of a computationally tractable analysis of the error floor phenomenon @xcite . \n an efficient numerical scheme was proposed , which was ab - initio by construction , i.e.  the optimization scheme required no additional assumptions ( e.g.  no sampling ) . \n this numerical optimization scheme , called the instanton - amoeba scheme , which plays a central role in our analysis , was shown to be accurate at producing configurations whose validity , for actual optimal noise configurations , can be verified theoretically . finally , the instanton - amoeba scheme , introduced in @xcite , is also generic , in that there are no restrictions related to the type of decoding or the channel .    to illustrate the last , most important point , we complement the analysis of @xcite that focused on the white gaussian symmetric channel , by using the new results for the white laplacian channel explained in this manuscript . \n our choice of the laplacian channel is arbitrary , e.g. influenced by its relevance to the description of fiber - optics communication channels . \n ( amplifier noise , known to have gaussian statistics , contributes additively to the electric signal carrying the information . \n however , the intensity , the electric field squared , is detected on the receiver end . \n therefore , the resulting transition probability , characterizing the noise in the fiber optics channel as the whole , shows exponential tails . \n see @xcite for a discussion of these and other statistical errors in fiber optics channels . ) \n our goal is to demonstrate using the example of the laplacian channel that    * the numerical optimization approach to finding the most damaging configuration of the noise , instanton - amoeba , is computationally efficient . * \n subsequent theoretical analysis of the iterative decoding instanton based on the notion of the computational tree is channel specific , but it is also generalizable , i.e. the theoretical scheme can be modified to explain the rational structure of instantons for any , in particular laplacian , channel . * \n instanton configurations for different channels are different . \n thus , information on the error - floor analysis available for a channel ( say , for the gaussian channel ) does not allow quantitative description of the error - floor in another channel ( say , in the laplacian channel ) . \n this manuscript is organized as follows . \n we describe the problem of error - floor analysis , introduce the laplacian channel and briefly review the results of @xcite in section  [ sec : intro ] . our theoretical analysis , generalizing the computational tree approach of @xcite , is detailed in section  [ sec : theo ] . \n section  [ sec : amoeba ] explains results of numerical instanton -

    "the dynamical mechanism at the origin of the non - local rheology of dense granular flows is investigated trough discrete element simulations . \n we show that the influence of a shear band on the mechanical behavior of a distant zone is contained in the spatial variations observed in the network of granular contacts . using a micro - rheology technique \n , we establish that the exponential responses hence obtained , do not proof the validity of a mechanical activation process as previously suggested , but stem from the spatial relaxation of the shear rate as a direct consequence of a macroscopic non - local constitutive relation . \n finally , by direct visualization of the local relaxation processes , we dismiss the kinetic elasto - plastic picture , where a flow is conceived as a quasi - static sequence of localized plastic events interacting through the stress field . \n we therefore conclude in favor of the jamming scenario , where geometrical constrains lead to coherent non - affine displacements along floppy modes , inherently non - local . \n soft amorphous materials are disordered assemblies of interacting particles that can resist shear like a solid , but which flow like a liquid under a sufficiently large applied shear stress , see @xcite and related references . \n the solid - like state is usually associated with highly multi - stable energy landscapes , whose origin allows one to classify these materials : entropy for colloidal suspensions @xcite , free energy for foams or emulsions ( surface tension ) as well as for soft elastomeric particles ( elasticity ) @xcite , and geometry for a granular material ( volume times imposed pressure ) @xcite . \n the rigidity transition is accordingly named colloidal glass transition , elasto - plastic depinning transition and jamming transition for these three classes of systems . like standard phase transitions , \n these dynamical transitions are associated with diverging length scales quantifying the degree of cooperativity in the flow or in the deformation response . amongst the consequences \n , experiments have shown that the rheology of granular materials and emulsions is non - local : the stress at a given location does not depend only on the local strain rate but also on the degree of mobility in the surrounding region @xcite . \n non - local constitutive relations were recently proposed and successfully tested against numerical and experimental results @xcite . \n as these relations are derived from a gradient expansion in the order parameter , analogous to a ginzburg -

locality . \n ( i ) for hard non - deformable grains , the topological analysis of the contact network provides a state parameter , the mean contact number @xmath8 , to distinguish between solid - like and liquid - like states . \n close to the jamming transition , flow is only possible along floppy modes , by essence spread in space and prescribing the cooperative motion of the particles @xcite . \n the evolution of the contact network results from the rapid formation of force chains followed by a slow zig - zag instability of these structures @xcite . \n ( ii ) for very elastic particles e.g. for foams , emulsions or glassy lennard jones phases , the dynamics in the quasi - static regime is controlled by elasto - plastic events  @xcite : when sheared , energy is slowly stored and rapidly released through scale - free avalanches , in close analogy with the depinning transition of an elastic line . \n recent experiments have suggested that an assembly of rigid particles could similarly present an intermittent succession of plastic events localized in space and time @xcite . \n ( iii ) the third picture is based on an analogy with eyring s transition state theory for the viscosity of liquids @xcite , where mechanical fluctuations would play the role of temperature in thermal systems . \n each plastic rearrangement is assumed to generate at random a new realization of the forces on the contact network , allowing for the formation of new weak zones where the next rearrangement will occur . in this letter \n , we will test successively these three pictures using discrete element simulations .    _ \n the numerical system _ is a 2d shear flow , similar to that used in  @xcite , and composed of grains confined between two rough solid walls . by means of gravity - like vertical forces \n , the normal stress @xmath9 is increased gradually in two thin boundary layers located close to the walls ( fig . \n [ fig1]a ) and reaches a constant value @xmath10 in the bulk ( fig . \n [ fig1]b ) . \n the yield parameter @xmath11 based on the shear stress @xmath0 , which is kept homogeneous across the cell , and on the dynamical friction coefficient @xmath12 is the central control parameter ( fig . \n [ fig1]b ) . in order to emphasize non - local effects , we focus here on the case @xmath13 , were the grains flow _ below the yield stress _ under the influence of the distant shear zone . \n _ _ the jamming framework  _ _ provides a picture of non - locality essentially based on the contact network geometry . \n the central criterion to render the status of a packing of hard grains is the mean contact number per grain @xmath8 . \n following maxwell rigidity criterion , we define the distance @xmath14 to isostaticity as the difference between the number of constrains and the number of degrees of freedom ( the number of force components ) . \n one must distinguish the case were a coulomb friction between the particles , of coefficient @xmath15 , is introduced from the frictionless case ( @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 were @xmath18 is the space dimension and @xmath19 the fraction of sliding contacts @xcite . \n a system is  solid  , i.e. rigid , when hyperstatic ( @xmath20 ) and  liquid  when hypostatic ( @xmath21 ) . \n importantly , this criterion is entirely non - local because it is global , which means that liquid or solid regions can hardly be isolated .    in our numerical system , \n @xmath8 and @xmath14 are defined as eulerian fields , by averaging over realizations or , equivalently , as we work with simulations in a statistically steady state , over time . in fig . \n [ fig1]c and fig .  [ fig1]d , we display profiles of @xmath14 , both in the frictional and frictionless cases . \n we first notice that all values are positive . \n these profiles can be fitted to a shape of the form @xmath22 . \n this means that @xmath14 spatially relaxes toward @xmath23 from both walls , in an exponential manner . \n the whole system ( the boundary layers and the bulk ) constitutes a single continuous liquid phase . from the jamming perspective , the flow in the bulk , observed when the stress is lower than the yield stress , results from a lack of coordination in the contact network . \n particles are expected to move cooperatively along floppy modes whose characteristic size diverges at the jamming point . \n a flowing region therefore favors the motion around it . \n as it affects the contact network geometry in its neighborhood , one expects the corresponding non - local correction to the rheology to remain finite in the limit of vanishing shear rate . \n since there is a relation between @xmath8 and the rescaled shear rate @xmath24  @xcite , this jamming picture is consistent with the non - local constitutive relation based on a gradient expansion in @xmath25 , derived , calibrated and tested in a previous letter @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the effective friction coefficient for homogeneous shear flows . \n the laplacian @xmath28 encodes the non - local effect , assumed isotropic ; it is rescaled by @xmath25 to form @xmath29 , which remains finite as @xmath30 . \n the linear expansion of the non - local correction is written as @xmath31 , with @xmath32 .    _ \n _ mechanical activation _ \n la eyring _  _ _ has recently been put forward in the interpretation of the experiments of reddy  _ et al _ @xcite . \n the conceptual idea of these authors was to measure the rheology within a shear band that is below the yield condition , but under the remote influence of a shear zone forced by rigid boundaries . as discussed below , \n an exponential behavior of the local shear rate with the distance to the yield condition has been interpreted as a boltzmann - like factor , with an effective ` temperature ' that would result from mechanical activation .    to investigate whether this behavior is consistent with the previous picture , we probe numerically the rheological response with a local micro - rheometer in the spirit of the set - up proposed by @xcite ( fig . \n [ fig2]a and @xcite ) . \n bulk horizontal forces acting on grains are added to impose a different shear stress in a small central region . \n fig . \n [ fig2]b shows the resulting profile of the yield parameter @xmath33 . as before , \n the flow is driven by the two boundary layers located close to the moving walls , which are above the yield condition . in the bulk \n , the flow is kept below the yield condition ( i.e. @xmath34 ) . \n the shear rate at the locations where @xmath33 crosses @xmath35 is noted @xmath36 and is considered as a boundary condition for the bulk rheology . \n the micro - rheometer is the central region where a different yield parameter @xmath37 is imposed . \n its thickness is noted @xmath38 and its location is @xmath39 away from the boundaries ( fig . \n [ fig2]a ) . \n the relation between the shear rate @xmath40 in the center of the micro - rheometer and the rescaled shear stress @xmath37 gives access to the local rheological properties . in practice , @xmath40 depends on four other parameters : @xmath36 , @xmath2 , @xmath39 and @xmath41 . in the experiments of @xcite , the micro - rheometer was a small rod immersed in a granular medium confined in a couette cell and submitted to an external force , which , once rescaled by its critical value , plays the role of @xmath37 . \n the rod creep velocity is the analogous of @xmath40 and the shear rate @xmath36 is the analogous of the rotation velocity of the inner cylinder . \n note that contrarily to the numerical set - up , the radial profile of the yield parameter @xmath33 is not homogeneous in the couette cell . \n the key observations reported in @xcite are recovered in the numerics . \n ( i ) the shear rate @xmath40 in the micro - rheometer is proportional to the shear rate @xmath36 imposed by the boundary ( fig . \n [ fig2]a ) . \n ( ii ) @xmath40 ( roughly ) decreases exponentially with the distance to the yield condition , measured by @xmath42 ( fig . \n [ fig2]b ) . \n this exponential dependence can be recovered by the non - local rheology : linearizing the constitutive relation ( [ rheononlocali ] ) around the critical state ( @xmath43 ) , the inertial number @xmath25 decays exponentially over a relaxation length @xmath44 @xcite . using the continuity of @xmath25 and @xmath45 at the interface @xmath46 \n , it is straightforward to integrate eq . \n [ rheononlocali ] @xcite . in the limit @xmath47 , \n the solution reads : @xmath48 \\!. \\qquad \\label{gammadots}\\ ] ] this solution is displayed in ( fig . \n [ fig2 ] ) and is in excellent agreement with the numerical simulation results , without any adjustable parameter , once the constitutive relation ( [ rheononlocali ] ) has been calibrated in the simple shear case . in particular , the two key properties ( i ) and ( ii ) are recovered . in conclusion , \n the exponential behaviors found either experimentally  @xcite or in the present simulations result from a linear relaxation of the shear rate . \n they do not point to a specific mechanism like mechanical activation , but to any mechanism that , like jamming , is roughly isotropic and leads to a finite non - local correction at vanishing shear rate .     as a function of the yield parameter @xmath37 in the micro - rheometer . \n ( a ) evidence for linearity of the response to the shear rate in the boundary layers @xmath36 .

local nature of the granular rheology \n , we compared the dynamics of two otherwise identical systems composed of hard and soft grains . \n the presence of localized plastic events is usually based on a visual inspection of different fields . \n the squared deviation from an affine deformation on a local scale has for instance been proposed as a field indicating plastic activity @xcite . \n however , such a quantity , as well as all those based on the non - affine velocity field , characterize fluctuations around the mean flow , and not the local contribution of a certain area to the mean flow . \n we wish here to propose a practical definition of these events , based on the quantitative criterion that they must be separated in time and localized in space . \n importantly , to match their role played in elasto - plastic models @xcite , they must also contribute additively to the average shear rate @xmath51 .    in order to detect localized plastic events , \n we have built a coarse - grained field @xmath57 reflecting , at time @xmath58 , the local contribution to @xmath51 of a small region around the position @xmath59 . \n we impose that the time average of @xmath60 must everywhere give @xmath51 . \n a coarse - graining method similar to that proposed for the stress tensor @xcite is adapted here to the computation of velocity differences \n see @xcite for the explicit expression of @xmath60 . \n we display in fig . \n [ fig4 ] for a system of rigid ( a ) and soft grains ( b ) , spatio -

particle system presents a narrow gaussian distribution of @xmath61 around @xmath51 , while the pdf corresponding to the soft system shows stretched tails , which are due to a very intermittent behavior associated with these plastic events ( fig . \n [ fig4]c ) . \n the pdf of @xmath55 provides informations about spatial heterogeneities in the system . \n the peak of the black line around @xmath62 in fig . \n [ fig4]d indicates that they are large and permanent in the hard system . for the soft system \n , the pdf shows an algebraic decay , which means that the field @xmath51 is homogeneous most of the time . \n however , when the computation of @xmath55 is restricted to the periods of time where plastic events occur ( periods where @xmath63 is larger than @xmath64 in fig . \n [ fig4]d ) , its pdf also presents a peak : in the soft system , plastic events are associated with a very heterogeneous field of @xmath60 . in conclusion , \n an assembly of rigid particles does not present local plastic events when sheared permanently . \n its dynamics is not intermittent but presents spatial heterogeneities . \n _ conclusion _    the study reported in this letter allows us to conclude that the non - locality in dense granular flows of rigid particles is consistent with the existence of floppy modes characterizing the jamming picture . \n the most striking observation is the lack of localized plastic events in such _ liquid _ flows . \n this seems to be in contradiction with the fact that plastic events have been observed experimentally in both soft @xcite and hard @xcite particle systems . \n however , from the jamming point of view , all these systems are _ solid _ : foams and emulsions present plastic events when they flow at high volume fraction ; a granular sample that is not prepared in the critical state by shearing is generically hyper - static , due to friction . \n this suggests that @xmath14 ( or the volume fraction ) could be the parameter controlling the cross - over between a non - local behavior ruled by the contact network geometry and another controlled by local plastic events . \n further numerical studies are required to investigate the nature of this cross - over . \n moreover , we have shown that the non - local constitutive relation proposed by bouzid et al . \n @xcite is able , without any other adjusting parameter or any assumption on the mechanisms at work , to predict the inhomogeneous fields stemming from a micro - rheological response . \n this results gives further incentive to clarify the relation between the constitutive coefficients and the most fundamental aspects of the soft - modes dynamics in the vicinity of the jamming transition . \n ba is supported by institut universitaire de france . \n this work is funded by the anr jamvibe and a cnes grant .    * *    supplementary material",

    "we address the use of simple quantum probes for the spectral characterization of classical noisy environments . in our scheme \n a qubit interacts with a classical stochastic field describing environmental noise and is then measured after a given interaction time in order to estimate the characteristic parameters of the noise . in particular , we address estimation of the spectral parameters of two relevant kinds of non - gaussian noise : random telegraph noise with lorentzian spectrum and colored noise with @xmath0 spectrum . \n we analyze in details the estimation precision achievable by quantum probes and prove that population measurement on the qubit is optimal for noise estimation in both cases . \n we also evaluate the optimal interaction times for the quantum probe , i.e. the values maximizing the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) and the quantum signal - to - noise ratio . for random telegraph noise \n the qfi is inversely proportional to the square of the switching rate , meaning that the quantum signal - to - noise ratio is constant and thus the switching rate may be uniformly estimated with the same precision in its whole range of variation . for colored noise , \n the precision achievable in the estimation of `` color '' , i.e. of the exponent @xmath1 , strongly depends on the structure of the environment , i.e. on the number of fluctuators describing the classical environment . \n for an environment modeled by a single random fluctuator estimation is more precise for pink noise , i.e. for @xmath2 , whereas by increasing the number of fluctuators , the quantum signal - to - noise ratio has two local maxima , with the largest one drifting towards @xmath3 , i.e. brown noise . \n in any communication channel or measurement scheme , the interaction of the information carriers with the external environment introduces noise in the system , thus degrading the overall performances . the precise characterization of the noise is thus a crucial ingredient for the design of high - precision measurements and reliable communication protocols . in many physical situations , \n the main source of noise is associated to the fluctuations of bistable quantities . in these cases , \n a suitable description of the noise is given in terms of classical stochastic processes @xcite . \n in particular , in the case of phase damping , i.e. pure dephasing , it has been shown that the interaction of a quantum system with a quantum bath can be written in terms of a random unitary evolution driven by a classical stochastic process @xcite . \n the characterization of classical noise is often performed by collecting a series of measurements to estimate the autocorrelation function and the spectral properties @xcite . \n this procedure is generally time consuming and may require the control of a complex system . \n a question thus arises on whether more effective techniques may be developed . to this purpose \n , we address the use of _ quantum probes _ to estimate the parameters of classical noise . \n we assume to have a quantum system interacting with the classical fluctuating field generating the noise and explore the performances of quantum measurements performed at a fixed interaction time to extract information about the classical noise . \n the power and implications of this idea are undeniable : the features of a complex system may be determined by monitoring a small probe , which is usually characterized by few and easily controllable degrees of freedom . \n the simplest and paradigmatic example of this situation is that of a qubit interacting with a noisy environment . \n after a given interaction time , which may be suitably optimized , quantum - limited measurements on the qubit may be used to characterize the environment , e.g. to estimate the parameters describing its noise spectrum .    in this paper \n we focus on the characterization of two classes of classical noise : random telegraph noise ( rtn ) with lorentzian spectrum and the power - law @xmath0 _ colored _ spectra arising from the interaction with a collection of random bistable fluctuators . \n both rtn and colored noise are examples of classical non - gaussian noise occurring in several system of interest . \n indeed , the microscopic models underlying these kinds of noise have been extensively analyzed in the literature @xcite . \n the relevant parameters characterizing this kinds of noise are the switching rate of the rtn and the exponent @xmath1 in the case of power - law spectra . \n both quantities do not correspond to observables in a strict sense and therefore we have to resort to indirect measurements performed on the quantum probe to infer their value . in order to optimize this inference procedure \n we employ tools from local quantum estimation theory @xcite , which have already been proved useful in the estimation of static noise parameters @xcite and in several other scenarios , as for example the estimation of quantum correlations @xcite , gaussian states @xcite , optical phase @xcite , critical systems @xcite and quantum thermometry @xcite . \n in particular , we will optimize the initial preparation of the qubit and the interaction time in order to maximize the quantum fisher information and the quantum signal - to - noise ratio . \n furthermore , we show that population measurement provides optimal inference for both the noise models . \n this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec1 ] we introduce the physical dephasing model employed throughout the paper and describe the main features of rtn and colored noise . in section [ sec2 ] \n we briefly review the main tools of quantum estimation theory , whereas in section [ sec3 ] we present our results on the precision achievable by quantum probes in the estimation of the spectral properties of noisy random environments . \n section [ sec4 ] closes the paper with concluding remarks .",

the most extensive investigations for the coupling to non strange baryon resonances were obtained from a self - consistent coupled channel approach to hadron and/or @xmath26-induced meson production on the nucleon @xcite or from a detailed analysis within the non relativistic constituent quark model @xcite . however \n , opposite to the last reference , it seems questionable to fix in a fairly model independent way the vertices @xmath25 , which still involve an overall arbitrary phase for the various resonances ; only the coupling to a given resonance is well defined with respect to the phases in @xmath19 , which are fairly well known . \n thus we focus here on a specific resonance , the @xmath27 and investigate the relative phases of selected @xmath16 couplings and the t - channel continuation of the coupling constants ( the same conclusions hold for the @xmath28 resonance ) . as we aim to apply our findings in a next step to meson exchange models at high momentum transfers up to 1 gev / c \n , our emphasis is to estimate form factors for the off - shell continuation in a ( at least approximately ) covariant , but still economical way . for this end \n , we compromise on our quark representation of the interacting hadrons : we represent baryons as quark - diquark objects @xcite , keeping in this work only the scalar - isoscalar component . for our purpose \n such an approximation seems well justified : different investigations show a strong dominance of the scalar component for the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon up to ( and beyond ) momentum transfers of 1 gev / c ;

the effective size parameter varies from its value @xmath39 for a nucleon at rest to    @xmath118    for @xmath119 ( fig.(2.b ) ) . \n + a quantitatively different structure is found for the pseudo - scalar and the space - like vector - meson @xmath0 vertices ( fig.(5 ) ) : while exponentially they exhibit a similar , gaussian - dominated behavior such as the scalar and time - like vector form factors , their overall momentum spectrum is enhanced : the overlap of the p - wave in the @xmath3 with the pseudo scalar ( p - wave ) operator , adds a @xmath120 to the overlap integral of the form factors , which leads to a typical momentum dependence ( for @xmath121 )    @xmath122    of course , for a quantitative insight into the structure of the different form factors a more realistic calculation is necessary .    * \n iv . \n summary and outlook * + summarizing our brief report , we formulated the dominant meson-@xmath1 and meson-@xmath0 vertices in a simple quark - diquark model for baryons , together with the assumption of the coupling of mesons as elementary objects ( a philosophy which strongly resembles the spirit of the quark - coupling - models @xcite ) . \n we extract both the relative phases between the @xmath16 vertices ( for p - wave dominated @xmath123 resonances ) and the momentum spectra of the hadronic form factors for momenta up to 1 gev / c . for our findings \n we feel on a safe ground for the relative phases of the coupling constants , however , the hadronic form factors should be improved in the light of more sophisticated representations for @xmath124 resonances ( we remark , however , that in contrast to the merits of our simple two - body representation of baryons the resolution into 3 quarks immediately raises the well known problems of center - of - mass corrections and lorentz - quenching @xcite ) . \n we expect that with continuous and sophisticated data from hadron and electron factories a much more profound understanding of the nature of baryon resonances may be gained in the near future . \n + in this note we did not address a further serious problem for the relative phases of the various meson exchange : i.e. the coupling of the @xmath3 vertices to the meson - nucleon continuum above the pion threshold . \n we are presently investigating this aspect - which gives rise to complex form factors - in a simple perturbative model , hoping for a more consistent understanding of meson - baryon vertices and thus of the structure @xmath3 resonances high in the continuum of the nucleon@xcite . \n 2.0 cm    * appendix * + here we collect the different overlap integrals for the hadronic form factors . \n @xmath125    @xmath126    @xmath127    @xmath128    @xmath129    with    @xmath130    ( for the @xmath3 vertices @xmath131 has to be replaced by @xmath132 in @xmath133 ) . \n 99 t. walcher : nucl . phys . \n * a50 * ( 2005 ) 185 ;

    "the relative contribution of baryons and dark matter to the inner regions of spiral galaxies provides critical clues to their formation and evolution , but it is generally difficult to determine . for spiral galaxies that are strong gravitational lenses , however , the combination of lensing and kinematic observations can be used to break the disk - halo degeneracy . in turn , \n such data constrain fundamental parameters such as i ) the mass density profile slope and axis ratio of the dark matter halo , and by comparison with dark matter - only numerical simulations the modifications imposed by baryons ; ii ) the mass in stars and therefore the overall star formation efficiency , and the amount of feedback ; iii ) by comparison with stellar population synthesis models , the normalization of the stellar initial mass function . in this first paper of a series \n , we present a sample of 16 secure , 1 probable , and 6 possible strong lensing spiral galaxies , for which multi - band high - resolution images and rotation curves were obtained using the hubble space telescope and keck - ii telescope as part of the sloan wfc edge - on late - type lens survey ( swells ) . \n the sample includes 8 newly discovered secure systems . \n we characterize the sample of deflector galaxies in terms of their morphologies , structural parameters , and stellar masses . \n we find that the swells sample of secure lenses spans a broad range of morphologies ( from lenticular to late - type spiral ) , spectral types ( quantified by h@xmath0 emission ) , and bulge to total stellar mass ratio ( 0.22 - 0.85 ) , while being limited to m@xmath1 m@xmath2 . \n the swells sample is thus well - suited for exploring the relationship between dark and luminous matter in a broad range of galaxies . \n we find that the deflector galaxies obey the same size - mass relation as that of a comparison sample of elongated non - lens galaxies selected from the sdss survey . \n we conclude that the swells sample is consistent with being representative of the overall population of high - mass high - inclination disky galaxies . \n [ firstpage ]    galaxies : spiral  galaxies : structure  galaxies : haloes  galaxies : fundamental parameters  gravitational lensing",

parameter field in ordinary homotopy theory . \n finally , the relative homotopy group is useful to calculate the absolute homotopy group via the exact sequence of homomorphisms .    as an illustrative example , let us again consider a ferromagnetic bec . \n suppose that the system is contained in a cylinder of radius @xmath0 and impose a boundary condition that the spin points in the positive @xmath1-direction at @xmath2 and outward or downward on the wall at @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the radial coordinate . \n then , the spin texture would look like @xmath5 \\frac{e^{i\\varphi}}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\sin \\beta(r ) \\\\[1 mm ] e^{2i\\varphi } \\sin^2 \\frac{\\beta(r)}{2 } \\end{pmatrix}. \\label{m - h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because the direction of spin is @xmath6 , the above boundary conditions are met if we choose @xmath7 and @xmath8 or @xmath9 . \n the topological objects corresponding to @xmath8 and @xmath9 are referred to as the mermin - ho vortex and anderson - toulouse vortex , respectively . \n it can be shown that the circulation at the wall is 1 for the mermin - ho vortex and 2 for the anderson - toulouse vortex . \n they are good examples of relative homotopy because both of them are not stable in free space and they can be stabilized only if the boundary conditions on the wall are imposed by some means .    in general , the @xmath10th relative homotopy group @xmath11 consists of the elements of @xmath12 from which those of @xmath13 are subtracted . \n we consider an @xmath10-sphere in @xmath14 and let it expand into @xmath15 by continuous deformation . \n such an expansion may be regarded as a one - to - one mapping of @xmath13 into a subgroup of @xmath12 . \n let im@xmath16 be the image of this homomorphism . \n then , by the definition given above , the relative homotopy @xmath11 is a quotient group of @xmath17 in @xmath12 : @xmath18    the relative first homotopy group @xmath19 can cope with planar defects with nontrivial boundaries . \n a well - known example is a planar soliton ( maki domain wall ) in the a phase of superfluid helium-3 , where the order - parameter manifold is @xmath20 within a dipole healing length from the domain wall and @xmath21 outside this layer due to dipole locking . \n the domain wall may be regarded as a linear defect as seen from the edge of the wall . \n we take the axis perpendicular to the domain wall as the @xmath1-axis . \n then , the order - parameter field defines a mapping from the @xmath1-axis into the contour in @xmath15 whose end points belong to @xmath14 . because @xmath22 , such contours are also classified as @xmath23 , of which the nontrivial one corresponds to the maki domain wall . \n the relative second homotopy group @xmath19 allows the stabilization of a point object subject to a boundary condition on a sphere enclosing it . \n another example is the boojum  a point defect that appears in the a phase of superfluid helium-3 when it is contained in a hard - wall sphere . because @xmath24 , the bulk superfluid a phase does not support a topologically stable point defect . \n however , because the @xmath25 vector must be perpendicular to the surface , a point singularity for the @xmath25-vector appears on the surface that is connected to a nonsingular vortex texture in the bulk . \n the line defects are characterized by the first homotopy group ( or the fundamental group ) @xmath26 . for the case of _ \n s_-wave superconductors , liquid helium-4 , and spin - polarized or spinless gaseous becs , the order parameter is scalar and the order - parameter manifold is @xmath27 . \n the fundamental group is therefore the additive group of integers : @xmath28    for the case of a spin-1 bec , the ground state can be ferromagnetic or polar . \n the order - parameter manifold of the ferromagnetic phase is so(3 ) and the fundamental group is @xmath29 , the two - element group . \n the spin configuration that corresponds to class 0 is continuously transformable to a uniform configuration , whereas the spin configuration that corresponds to class 1 describes a singly quantized vortex that is topologically stable . because 1 + 1 = 0 in @xmath30 , the coalescence of two singly quantized vortices is homotopic to a uniform configuration . \n conversely , there is a configuration called the anderson - toulouse vortex that is nonsingular at the origin but has circulation of two away from the origin . \n next , let us consider the polar phase of a spin-1 bec . \n the order - parameter manifold is @xmath31/({\\mathbb z}_2)_{{\\bm f},\\phi}$ ] . as we have discussed in sec . \n [ sec : sym_opm ] , the @xmath32 symmetry arises from the fact that the order parameter given by eq . \n is invariant under the simultaneous transformation of @xmath33 . \n because @xmath34 is not simply connected , to calculate @xmath35 , we lift @xmath36 to @xmath37 and use eq .  . \n then , the points that are identical to @xmath38 in @xmath39 are @xmath40 for even @xmath10 and @xmath41 for odd @xmath10 , and those points constitute an additive group of integers @xmath10 . \n hence , we have @xmath42 as in the case of a scalar bec , vortices in the polar phase are classified by integers . \n however , due to the @xmath32 discrete symmetry , the minimum unit of circulation is one - half of the usual value of @xmath43 , as discussed in sec . \n [ sec : vortex_spin1polar ] .    in a similar manner \n , we may expect that the uniaxial , biaxial , and cyclic phases in spin-2 spinor becs can support various types of vortices due to the discrete symmetry , as discussed in sec . \n [ sec : vortices ] . \n some of them have fractional circulations , and some others have no mass circulation . \n the topological charge can be expressed algebraically as a functional of the order - parameter field . the topological charge corresponding to @xmath44 \n can be expressed as a line integral of the velocity field . \n point defects are characterized by the second homotopy group . because @xmath45 , scalar becs have no topologically stable point defects . \n when the order - parameter manifold is @xmath46 , it can host monopoles because @xmath47 .    here \n , we consider the situation shown in fig . \n [ fig : homotopy3 ] , where @xmath48 is a mapping from @xmath46 to @xmath46 . \n the topological charge @xmath49 of the point defect can be calculated as follows . by definition \n , @xmath49 gives the number of times the vector @xmath48 shown in fig . \n [ fig : homotopy3 ] wraps @xmath46 . expressing the components of this vector in spherical coordinate as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 \n , we can calculate @xmath49 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the spherical coordinates of @xmath57 , and the last term on the right - hand side is the jacobian of the transformation of the coordinates . \n the fact that the integrand is the jacobian explicitly indicates that @xmath49 gives the degree of mapping from @xmath46 in real space to @xmath46 in order - parameter space . the right - hand side of eq . \n ( [ n_2 ] ) can be directly expressed in terms of @xmath58 as @xmath59 where @xmath60 we can use gauss law to rewrite the right - hand side of eq . \n ( [ n_22 ] ) as a volume integral : @xmath61 where @xmath62 gives the density distribution of point singularities . + * t - hooft - polyakov monopole ( hedgehog ) *    next , we consider the polar phase . \n the second homotopy group is given by @xmath63 , and therefore , it can accommodate point defects . to investigate their nature , we write the order parameter in the following form : @xmath64 by setting @xmath65 , we obtain the spherical monopole called t - hooft - polyakov monopole or hedgehog : @xmath66 it follows from eq .   that the topological charge of the hedgehog is @xmath67 . \n moreover , @xmath68 defined in eq . \n is related to the circulation of spin currents given by eq .   as @xmath69 which implies that the surface integral of the spin circulation is quantized in terms of @xmath70 \n ; @xmath71 + * alice ring *    the monopole in the spin-1 polar phase is energetically unstable against deformation into an alice ring  @xcite . \n the alice ring is a combined object of two defects characterized by @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( see fig . \n [ fig : homotopy7 ] ) . \n viewed far from the origin , it appears to be a point defect ( @xmath67 ) ; however , along the ring @xmath74 on which the order parameter is singular , it appears to be a continuous distribution of line defects ( @xmath75 ) . \n this topological object is called the alice ring , and it has been predicted to be realized in an optically trapped spin-1 @xmath76na bec  @xcite . \n +    * dirac monopole *    the magnetic monopole was originally envisaged as a magnetic analogue of the quantized electric charge : @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the strength of the magnetic monopole . \n the solution of this equation is easily found to be @xmath79 and the corresponding vector potential is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 are the polar coordinates and @xmath82 is the unit vector in the @xmath83-direction . \n the vector potential ( [ vectora ] ) reproduces the magnetic field ( [ bfield ] ) , except on the positive @xmath1-axis along which the magnetic field exhibits a singularity called the dirac string : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the unit vector along the @xmath1-direction . \n the dirac monopole can be created in the ferromagnetic phase of a spin-1 bec  @xcite . \n substituting @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 in eq . \n ( [ eqscb88 ] ) , we obtain @xmath89 \\frac{e^{-i\\varphi}}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\sin\\theta \\\\[1 mm ]               \\sin^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2}. \\end{pmatrix } \\label{dirac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding superfluid velocity @xmath90 [ defined by eq .  ] \n is the same as the vector potential ( [ vectora ] ) of the dirac monopole with the identification @xmath91 . \n it is interesting to note that the order parameter ( [ dirac ] ) exhibits a doubly quantized vortex only along the positive @xmath1-axis . \n one can say that because the first homotopy group of so(3 ) is @xmath32 , which allows only a singly quantized vortex called a polar - core vortex as a stable topological object , the doubly quantized vortex must terminate at the magnetic monopole . \n in fact , the singular dirac monopole can deform continuously to a nonsingular spin texture if we take the following parametrization : @xmath92 \\frac{e^{-i\\varphi}}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\sin\\beta \\\\[1 mm ]               \\sin^2 \\frac{\\beta}{2 } \\end{pmatrix } , \\ \\ \n \\ \\beta(r,\\varphi , z)=\\theta ( 1-t)+\\pi t. \\label{dirac2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can see that as @xmath93 increases from 0 to 1 , the order parameter continuously changes from the dirac monopole at @xmath94 to a nonsingular texture @xmath95 at @xmath96 .      when two different types of topological objects coexist , there exists an action of one object on the other as they move relative to each other . as an example , consider a spin-1 polar phase in which two monopoles with charge 1 merge in the presence of a half - quantum vortex . \n as a monopole turns around the vortex , it changes sign . \n thus , if they merge along line 1 , the order - parameter field must deform , as shown in fig .  [ \n fig : homotopy9 ]  ( b ) , and the combined object has the topological charge of two . on the other hand , when they merge along line 2 , the order - parameter manifold can deform into the one shown in fig . \n [ fig : homotopy9 ]  ( c ) , and the topological charge is zero , indicating that the two monopoles annihilate in pairs . \n this example illustrates that the charge of the monopole changes its sign as it moves around the half - quantum vortex along curve 2 .      * \n shankar skyrmion *    the third homotopy group characterizes topological objects called skyrmions that extend over the entire three - dimensional space . \n a prime example of this is the so - called shankar monopole  @xcite , although it is actually not a monopole but a skyrmion . \n the topology of the shankar skyrmion is @xmath97 , which is supported by the ferromagnetic phase of a spin-1 bec . \n the order parameter of the ferromagnetic bec is characterized by the direction of the local spin @xmath98 and the superfluid phase that can be parametrized in terms of two unit vectors such as @xmath99 and @xmath100 that form a triad with @xmath101 : @xmath102 . \n concrete forms of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are introduced in sec . \n [ sec : vortex_spin1ferro ] .    the class one element of @xmath97 may be realized by rotating the triad at position @xmath57 about the direction  @xcite @xmath103 through an angle @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 . \n it follows from the last condition that the triad is uniform in spatial infinity , and thus , the three - dimensional space is compacted to @xmath107 . \n the case of @xmath108 is shown in fig . \n [ fig : homotopy8 ] . \n the topological charge of the third homotopy group can be introduced in a manner similar to that of the second homotopy group . \n now , the mapped vector has a four - component vector that is normalized to unity . \n one such representation is @xmath109 the invariant of such a mapping is again given by the jacobian of the transformations : @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the completely antisymmetric tensors of the third and fourth orders , respectively , and the roman letters run over @xmath113 and the greek letters run over @xmath114 . + * knot soliton *    the third homotopy group also classifies knot solitons . \n knots differ from other topological excitations such as vortices , monopoles , and shankar monopoles in that they are classified by a linking number while others are classified by winding numbers . \n knots are characterized by mappings from a three - dimensional sphere @xmath107 to @xmath46 . as in the case of shankar monopoles , \n the @xmath107 domain is prepared by imposing a boundary condition that the order parameter takes on the same value in every direction at spatial infinity . here , we consider the spin-1 polar phase  @xcite . \n the order parameter manifold of the polar phase is given by @xmath115 , of which neither @xmath116 nor @xmath32 symmetry contributes to the homotopy groups in spaces higher than one dimension ;

dimensional and three - dimensional disordered structures . \n fifty five years after its discovery @xcite , anderson localization remains an actively developing field @xcite . \n one of central directions of the current research is the physics of anderson localization transitions @xcite . \n these include both metal - insulator transitions and quantum hall plateau transitions ( and , more generally , transitions between different phases of topological insulators ) . \n such transitions have been experimentally observed and studied in a variety of semiconductor structures @xcite . \n recent discoveries of graphene @xcite and time - reversal - invariant topological insulator materials @xcite have further broadened the arena for their experimental exploration . \n in addition to electronic systems , there is a number of further experimental realizations of anderson localization , including localization of light @xcite , cold atoms @xcite , ultrasound @xcite , and optically driven atomic systems @xcite . \n anderson transitions are quantum phase transitions and are characterized by critical scaling of various physical observables . \n a particularly remarkable property of anderson transitions is the multifractality of critical wave functions which implies their very strong fluctuations . \n specifically , at the critical point the wave - function moments or equivalently , the averaged participation ratios @xmath1 show anomalous multifractal scaling with respect to the system size @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the spatial dimension , @xmath5 denotes the averaging over disorder , and @xmath6 are anomalous multifractal exponents distinguishing the critical point from a conventional metallic phase , where @xmath7 . \n we refer the reader to ref . \n @xcite for an overview of this research area . \n very recently , a complete classification of observables characterizing critical wave functions ( that includes multifractal moments ( [ e1 ] ) as a `` tip of the iceberg '' ) was developed @xcite . \n the above results on multifractality have been obtained for _ non - interacting _ disordered systems . in the case of broken spin invariance \n they remain valid in the presence of short - range ( e.g. , screened by external gate ) electron - electron interaction which , in this case , is irrelevant in the renormalization - group ( rg ) sense @xcite . \n on the other hand , the long - range ( @xmath8 ) coulomb interaction is rg relevant and may have strong impact on localization properties of the system ( see refs . \n @xcite for review ) . \n in particular , it induces a metal - insulator transition in ( otherwise localized ) two - dimensional systems with preserved spin and time - reversal invariances @xcite . \n further , the coulomb interaction induces a strong suppression of the local density of states ( ldos ) @xmath9 near zero energy @xmath10 ( counted from the chemical potential ) @xcite . \n the ldos can be measured in a tunneling experiment , and this phenomenon is known as zero - bias anomaly ( zba ) . \n specifically , in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) weakly disordered system the disorder - averaged ldos behaves as @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dimensionless ( measured in units @xmath13 ) conductivity . \n the physics of a 2d disordered systems is closely related to the behavior at anderson transition , since @xmath14 is a logarithmic ( lower critical ) dimension . the unconventional behavior ( [ e2 ] ) with squared logarithm in the exponential ( rather than with a simple logarithm that would yield a power law , as normally expected for critical behavior ) is related to the fact that the ldos is affected by gauge - type phase fluctuations that yield a suppression of debye - waller type . for the anderson transition in @xmath15 dimensions ( with @xmath16 allowing a parametric control of the theory ) in systems with broken time - reversal and/or spin symmetries , one of the logarithmic factors in eq . \n ( [ e2 ] ) transforms into a factor @xmath17 @xcite . \n since the critical conductance @xmath18 is of order @xmath19 as well , this yields @xmath20 with precise value of the critical exponent @xmath21 depending on the symmetry class . specifically , up to corrections of order @xmath22 , one finds @xmath23 , @xmath24 $ ] , and 1 , for the problems with magnetic impurities , magnetic field , and spin - orbit scattering , respectively @xcite . in view of a combination of disorder and interaction physics , such metal - insulator transitions \n are often called mott - anderson ( or anderson - mott ) transitions . \n we remind that in the absence of interaction the ldos is uncritical , @xmath25 , in conventional ( wigner - dyson ) symmetry classes . \n we are thus facing the following important question : does multifractality survive in the presence of coulomb interaction between electrons ? \n the goal of this paper is to answer this question . \n specifically , we will show that on top of the zba suppression of the average @xmath26 , the ldos of a strongly interacting critical system does show multifractal fluctuations and correlations . \n we will also calculate the corresponding spectrum of anomalous dimensions in @xmath0 spatial dimensions up to the two - loop order and demonstrate that it differs from that of a non - interacting system . \n note that the question addressed in this letter is of direct experimental relevance . \n in particular , a recent work @xcite performed scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) of a magnetic semiconductor ga@xmath27mn@xmath28as near metal - insulator transition and detected ldos fluctuations and correlations of mutlifractal character . \n strong fluctuations of the ldos in a strongly disordered 3d system ( presumably , on the insulating side of the transition ) have been also observed in ref . \n @xcite . \n further , recent works on stm of 2d semiconductor systems and graphene @xcite demonstrated the feasibility to explore fluctuations and correlations of the ldos also near the quantum hall transitions . \n finally , strong spatial fluctuations of the ldos have been also detected near the superconductor - insulator transition in disordered films @xcite that is known to have much in common with the metal - insulator transition . \n we turn now to the presentation of our results . \n the ldos is formally defined as an imaginary part of the single - particle green function , @xmath29 . \n we find that near the anderson localization transition the moments of ldos normalized to its average show multifractal scaling , @xmath30^q \\bigr   \\rangle / \\langle \\rho(e )   \\rangle^q \\sim ( \\mathcal{l}/l ) ^{-\\delta_q } , \\label{e4}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 denotes a microscopic length scale of the order of elastic scattering mean free path and @xmath32 is the shorter of the three lengths : the localization ( correlation ) length @xmath33 , the dephasing length @xmath34 , and the system size @xmath2 @xcite . \n the correlation length diverges at the transition point in a power - law fashion , @xmath35 , with an exponent @xmath36 . \n further , the dephasing length ( controlled by inelastic scattering processes ) diverges at zero energy ( we remind that all energies are counted from the chemical potential ) , @xmath37 , with a dynamical exponent @xmath38 . \n the power - law scaling ( [ e4 ] ) of the normalized ldos moments is governed by a set of exponents @xmath6 . \n these exponents control also spatial power - law correlations of the ldos at scales @xmath39 . \n ( at large distances , @xmath40 , the ldos become essentially uncorrelated . ) in particular , the correlation function of two ldos at different points shows at @xmath41 the following scaling : @xmath42 where @xmath43 . \n correlations between the ldos at different energies have analogous scaling properties , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and it is assumed that @xmath46 .    to derive the above results , we use the non - linear @xmath47 model ( nl@xmath47 m ) field - theoretical approach to interacting disordered systems @xcite . to keep the analysis parametrically under control , \n we consider the anderson transition in @xmath15 dimensions , where the critical conductance @xmath18 is large ( i.e. the corresponding @xmath47 model coupling @xmath48 is weak ) . \n this allows us to obtain an @xmath22 expansion for critical exponents . in spirit of usual ideology of critical phenomena \n , it is expected that the scaling results - are of general validity and hold also at strong - coupling critical points of coulomb - interacting disordered systems , such as metal - insulator transitions in 3d or quantum hall plateau transitions . \n we consider a system of disordered fermions with coulomb interaction in the absence of time reversal and spin rotational symmetries , which corresponds to the symmetry class `` mi(lr ) '' in terminology of ref . \n @xcite ) . \n the rg analysis of the anderson metal - insulator transition in @xmath15 dimensions for this symmetry class was developed up to two - loop order in refs  @xcite . \n renormalization of the dimensionless conductance @xmath12 is governed by the following @xmath21-function @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the running rg length scale , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . the condition @xmath53 determines the position of the critical point : @xmath54 ( and thus the critical conductance @xmath55 ) . \n further , the localization length exponent is determined by the derivative of the @xmath21-function at the fixed point , @xmath56 . \n the dynamical exponent connecting the energy and length scaling at criticality is also known up to the two - loop order : @xmath57 @xcite .    to determine the scaling of ldos moments , we translate the corresponding correlation functions into the nl@xmath47 m language . \n we use the matsubara version of the interacting @xmath47 model , and introduce replicas in order to perform the disorder averaging . \n a detailed two - loop rg analysis ( see supporting material @xcite ) demonstrates that the scaling behavior of moments of the normalized ldos , @xmath58^q$ ] , is governed by the anomalous dimensions @xmath59 \n + o(t^3 ) . \n \\label{eq2e2}\\ ] ] this proves the anomalous scaling ( [ e4 ] ) and determines the multifractal exponents at the critical point : @xmath60+o(\\epsilon^3 ) . \n \\label{eq2e3}\\ ] ] an extension of this analysis onto correlation functions of ldos at different spatial points and/or energies yields eqs . \n ( [ e5 ] ) , ( [ e6 ] ) and their generalizations onto higher correlation functions @xcite .    to illustrate the origin of obtained fluctuations and correlations of the ldos \n , we show in fig . \n [ figure1 ] representative diagrams for the correlation function @xmath61 . \n each ldos is given by a fermionic loop dressed by interaction lines . \n averaging each loop over disorder generates diffusive vertex corrections and yields the zba . \n on the other hand , diffusons connecting the loops lead to multifractal correlations . \n the rg effectively sums up the leading contributions of the diagrams with multiple interaction lines and intra- and inter -

interacting disordered fermions without time reversal symmetry ( the wigner - dyson unitary class a ) , the @xmath21-function , the critical point and the localization length exponent are known up to the five - loop order @xcite @xmath62 @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . \n the anomalous dimensions of operators which determine the scaling behavior of the ldos moments have been computed at the four - loop level @xcite with the result @xmath65 where @xmath66 stands for the riemann zeta function . \n this leads to the following expression for the corresponding multifractal exponents : @xmath67 comparing eqs . and \n , one sees that coulomb interaction changes the @xmath21-function and , consequently , the fixed point and critical exponents . \n thus , anderson transitions with and without coulomb interaction belong to different universality classes .    while we have shown that multifractality of the ldos persists in the presence of coulomb interaction , the values of the multifractal dimensions , eq . , are essentially different from their non - interacting counterparts . \n this happens both because of a difference in the corresponding scaling functions [ cf . \n eqs . and ] and because of different values of critical resistance @xmath68 . \n we mention that in both cases in the two - loop approximation the spectrum of anomalous dimensions @xmath6 ( and thus the so - called singularity spectrum @xmath69 that is obtained by the legendre transformation ( see e.g. ref . \n @xcite ) is parabolic , @xmath70 . \n it is expected , however , that higher - loop contribution will break the exact parabolicity in the coulomb case , in analogy with what happens ( in the four - loop order ) in the non - interacting model .    for small @xmath22 , \n when the values of the exponents are parametrically controlled , the coulomb interaction considerably reduces numerical values of the anomalous exponent , i.e. weakens multifractality . as an example , for @xmath71 we get @xmath72 in the absence and @xmath73 in the presence of interaction . in the physically most interesting case of dimensionality @xmath74 , \n i.e. @xmath75 , we can only use the one - loop term as an estimate . \n this yields in the non - interacting case @xmath76 and @xmath77 , in fairly well agreement with numerical results . \n an analogous estimate based on our results for the interacting system yields @xmath72 and @xmath78 . \n note that at @xmath75 the second - loop term in eq . \n is numerically of the same order ( by absolute value ) as the one - loop term ; thus , this estimate is expected to be quite rough .    to visualize the critical ldos correlations near a metal - insulator transition \n , we present in fig . \n [ figure2a2b ] a color - code plot of the autocorrelation function @xmath79[\\rho(e,\\bm{r}+\\bm{r } ) -\\langle\\rho(e)\\rangle]\\rangle/\\langle\\rho(e)\\rangle^2 $ ] [ cf . \n eq . ] . \n this presentation is analogous to figs . 4a and 4b of the experimental paper @xcite . for this plot , \n we have chosen the following values of the critical exponents : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , which are theoretical estimates obtained by taking @xmath75 in the one - loop results for the case of coulomb interaction . \n the left panel ( fig . [ figure2a2b]a ) corresponds to the case when the system is exactly at the transition point , @xmath83 . \n we see the long - range multifractal correlation at low energies ; since @xmath84 ( as is also the case for experimental estimates of the corresponding exponents at 3d metal - insulator transitions and at quantum hall transitions ) , the range of correlation @xmath85 is controlled by the dephasing length @xmath34 . in the right panel \n ( fig . \n [ figure2a2b]b ) , the system is slightly off the transition , i.e. , @xmath86 is now non - zero . in this case \n @xmath85 is governed by the correlation ( localization ) length @xmath33 in a certain window around zero energy and by @xmath34 outside this window . \n all essential features of fig . \n [ figure2a2b ] compare well with fig.4 of ref . \n @xcite . \n [ \\rho(e,\\bm{r}+\\bm{r})-\\langle\\rho(e)\\rangle ] \\rangle/\\langle\\rho(e)\\rangle^2 $ ] for the system a ) at the critical point , @xmath83 , and b ) slightly on the metallic side , @xmath87 . \n the energy is measured in units of elastic scattering rate which sets the ultraviolet cutoff of the nl@xmath47 m theory . the dashed line in a ) and b ) corresponds to @xmath88 . , title=\"fig:\",width=151][\\rho(e,\\bm{r}+\\bm{r})-\\langle\\rho(e)\\rangle ] \n \\rangle/\\langle\\rho(e)\\rangle^2 $ ] for the system a ) at the critical point , @xmath83 , and b ) slightly on the metallic side , @xmath87 . \n the energy is measured in units of elastic scattering rate which sets the ultraviolet cutoff of the nl@xmath47 m theory . the dashed line in a ) and b ) corresponds to @xmath88 . , title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    to summarize \n , we have shown that the multifractal fluctuations and correlations of the ldos persist in the presence of coulomb interaction but the spectrum of multifractal exponents is modified . by using the nl@xmath47 m approach , we have calculated the multifractality spectrum of an interacting system without time - reversal and spin symmetries up to the two - loop order in @xmath0 dimensions . \n our results are in an overall agreement with the experimental data of ref . \n @xcite . \n we hope that our work will motivate further experimental studies of multifractality of interacting electrons near metal - insulator and quantum hall transitions . on the theoretical side \n , our paper paves a way to a systematic investigation of multifractality at interacting critical points of localization transitions . \n there exists by now a vast knowledge on properties of multifractality in the absence of interaction , including , in particular , systems of different symmetry classes and different dimensionalities , symmetries of mutlifractal spectra , termination and freezing , implications of conformal symmetry , connection to entanglement entropy , and manifestation of multifractality in various observables @xcite . \n in the presence of coulomb interaction , the corresponding physics remains to be explored . \n in addition to metal - insulator transitions and transitions between different phases of topological insulators , we envision a possibility to extend this analysis also to superconductor - insulator transitions .    while we were preparing this paper for publication , a preprint appeared @xcite where an analogous problem is addressed numerically within a self - consistent hartree - fock approximation . \n we thank a.  yazdani , a.w.w . \n ludwig , b.i . \n shklovskii , and m.a . \n skvortsov for discussions . \n the work was supported by dfg - rfbr in the framework of spp 1285 , bmbf , russian president grant no . \n mk-4337.2013.02 , dynasty foundation , rfbr grant no . \n 12 - 02 - 00579 , russian ministry of education and science under contract no . \n 8385 , and by ras programs `` quantum mesoscopic and disordered systems '' , `` quantum physics of condensed matter '' , and `` fundamentals of nanotechnology and nanomaterials '' . \n 99    p.w . \n anderson , phys . rev . * 109 * , 1492 ( 1958 ) .    , ed . by e.  abrahams \n ( world scientific , 2010 ) . \n f.  evers and a.d . \n mirlin , rev . \n mod . \n phys . \n * 80 * , 1355 ( 2008 ) . \n see , in particular , h. stupp , m. hornung , m. lakner , o. madel , and h. v. lhneysen phys . \n rev . \n lett . * 71 * , 26342637 ( 1993 ) ;

fft image shows ( along the line profile between the white arrows ) the k - vector with several magnitudes , which falls expontially as seen in the inset . \n this shows the long range interactions of the electronic charge density modulations . \n when the scan size is reduced in panels ( g ) and ( i ) the respective 2d - fft images in panels ( h ) and ( j ) , the bright spots are seen forming rectangular positions , corresponding to the charge density modulations . in panel \n ( k ) in figure 1 , the scan image is shown over 12.7 nm x 12.7 nm . two orienations of the charge modulations can be seen along with the atomic level features in the topographic image . \n a blue and green color lines identify these two orienations . in panel \n ( l ) , we show the 2d - fft image of panel ( k ) along with the magnified portion in the inset . we observe four bright spots , for two orienations of the charge modulations , encirled with green and blue lines , respectively . at smaller wavelengths , as shown in the main panel ( l ) , six bright spots are circled using black lines , marking the underlying hexagonal atomic positions in the image in panel ( k ) . \n the distances of these bright spots in the units of lattice parameter @xmath6 would form the planes [ 210 ] and [ 200 ] . \n the lattice of tin in the atomic images results from the small single crystallites oriented randomly where the exposed surface is on the the cuts of the fcc lattice , giving atomic size features of either rectangular , square or hexagonal symmetry . \n the observed modulation wavevectors can be associated to one of the principal directions of the bulk fcc lattice , implying that the growth is produced in the same way as in the bulk , however , along the strongly differing orientations . \n average crystallite size is between 3 - 8 nm , and the atomic lattices are separated by the low angle crystalline boundaries . \n the disordered tin film shows clearly additional coherent charge density modulations incommensurate with the atomic lattice ( also see figure s2 ) . \n these modulations have wavevectors between 2 - 10 times the interatomic distances . these modulations with sizes between 20 - 40 nm cross several crystallite boundaries . \n this is a purely electronic effect , showing vividly electron localization in the form of standing waves , and producing an unexpected charge ordering pattern , superposed to the crystalline structure . \n these images demonstrate the existence of `` coherence patches '' , whose size is orders of magnitude above the mean free path estimated from resistivity to about 10 nm . these patches will conform to a large extent the macroscopic electronic conduction behavior . \n let us review the known electronic properties of tin . \n the fermi surface and bandstructure of bulk tin has been obtained in de haal van alphen and angular resolved photoemission experients . in the bulk , there are three bands crossing the fermi surface , two of them giving small nearly cubic fermi surfaces close to the zone center , and one rather involved large three dimensional fermi surface . \n fermi wavevectors are distributed over the whole brillouin zone . as is well known , \n stm can probe , in addition to atomic arrangements , charge dentisy waves . these may be either an intrinsic deformation of the electronic bandstructure , in which case they have a well defined orientation and wavevector over the whole sample , or they may appear due to inelastic electron scattering at the crystalline boundries . as we are measuring a very thin film , with a thickness well below the length scale over which modulations extend , \n we are probing the charge pattern formed by disorder in the whole film . \n generally , electronic waves are formed from scattering events occuring between two parts of the fermi surface , joined by a fermi wavevector @xmath7@xmath8 which gives the wavelength of the charge modulations in the stm image . \n we can compare the @xmath7@xmath8 measured from our images with the length scales characteristic of the tin metal obtained from macroscopic resistance measurements . taking the diffusion constant , of @xmath9 = 0.32 @xmath10/s , and @xmath11@xmath8 = 10@xmath12 s , obtained from the 2d fermi energy expression , \n e@xmath8 = @xmath13@xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 with electron density n = 5 x 10@xmath17 m@xmath18 we find @xmath7@xmath8 = 1 nm , of order of the size of the charge modulations we observed in the images ( figure s2 ) . as shown in the patterns in large scale images , charge density modulations \n are observed particularly along preferential directions . \n this shows that scattering is between small parts of the fermi surface at an angle to the high symmetry axis . \n [ [ sts -

particle peak positions tend to suppress proportionally . in panel ( c ) the average tunneling conductance for each curve between -1 to + 1 mv was calculated , and plotted spatially over the same area . \n the map consists of total 128 x 128 values of the average conductance obtained from each tunneling conductance curve . \n inset in panel ( c ) shows the histogram of the average of the sum of the conductance , which peaks around 0.7 over the scale of 0 to unity . in the main panel ( c ) \n the color scale is same as that in the panel ( b ) , and clearly the average conductance has much sharper width than the conductance values at a specific bias voltage . \n this points to the fact that the total density of states remain same , while it is distributed in spatially varying behavior in the superconducting state . \n we extend the sts measurement to other larger scan areas . \n the tunneling conductance behavior changes spatially as shown in the inset in the panel fig.2 ( d ) . \n the area under investigation was 455 nm x 455 nm and for the most part of it the superconducting gap opens with the bcs - like quasi - particle peaks ( inset in panel ( d ) ) , however , in several curves the peaks are either suppressed or altogether absent , with the equivalent rounding near zero bias voltage . in order to generate a picture of the conductance distribution at the selected bias voltage of 0.25 mv , \n all the tunneling conductance curves are normalized at 1 mv . \n the normalized conductance varies from 0 to 1 , as shown in the color scale in fig . \n 2(d ) . \n the dark blue color is the region where the conductance at 0.25 mv reaches near zero values , while the red region has the conductance close to 0.7 and is also a representative of the region where the curves without quasi - particle peaks are seen . \n spatial changes were reported previously in terms of the average superconducting gap of ref.[8 ] , however a clear distinction between two behaviors , with and without quasi - particle peaks , was not established . in the panel ( e ) , the average of the sum of the conductance in the bias voltage range -1 to + 1 mv ( on the color scale from 0 to 1 ) for each of the 128 x 128 curves is plotted over the same area . \n the average of the sum of the conductance values in the form of the histogram are shown in the inset in panel ( e ) . \n the histograms peaks at 0.75 , and the average conductance spatially varies in a range about 30 percent to that of the full range . in particular 5 percent change at the right edge of \n the histogram pertains to the slight contrast present between the regions with two distinct conductance behavior shown in panel ( d ) . \n the other observation from panel ( e ) is that the average conductance deviates ( in fact , is lower ) from unity which would be in the case of a bcs - superconducting gap . in panel \n ( f ) , the underlying image of the selected surface is shown . \n the color changes represent the movement of the tip - position which is confined within 3 nm . however , these are not the changes of the topographic profile , but the effect of the tip - interaction at the positions of the strong charge density modulations present over the entire surface . in the central part of the image , the parallel lines are indicative of the beating positions of the charge density modulations . in some sense the panel ( f ) \n shows the density of the charge redistributed in the film in the presence of disorder . \n clearly areas surrounding the beating positions are strongly affected compared to the regions slightly far . \n these areas where density of states also strongly fluctuates form zones , where due to a strong charge density , the superconducting gap does not develop . \n the absence of quasi - particle peaks assert that there is a tendency to phase break at these positions weaking the superconducting state .    in figure 3 \n , we provide the conductance maps at selected bias voltages from 0.0 mv to 0.75 mv at an interval of 0.05 mv . in each panel , \n the bias voltage is shown in the top left corner , and the color scale represents the change of the conductance pertaining to the maximal values at that bias voltage . \n such a represenation is chosen in order to highlight visually the change in the spatial conductance maps with the increase in the bias voltage . at v = 0.0 mv , \n a small contrast is seen in the region which have the conductance curves without the quasi - particle peaks . \n we believe this should mimic the fluctuations in the density of states when the film is normal . \n the contrast between the two regions ( with and without quasi - particle peaks ) increases with the bias voltage , and at 0.25 mv , the maximum contrast can be seen in the conductance map . with further increase in the bias voltage , \n the contrast decreases , and nearly disappears at 0.4 mv , except at the interface between the regions separating two types of conductance behaviors , where the white lines appear which corresponds to the lower conductance values for these curves . \n the near uniform contrast at 0.4 mv corresponds to the crossover of the majority of the tunneling conductance curves exhibiting two behaviors . from 0.45 mv \n the bright regions highlight the reversal of the relative conductance changes between the two regions , and it continues to peak at the bias voltage of 0.55 mv , close to the position of the quasi - particle peaks in the bcs - like curves . \n further increase in the bias voltage decreases the contrast , and near uniform conductance maps are seen from 0.7 mv onwards upto 1 mv . \n the uniform conductance ( without any trace of two different regions ) at 0.75 mv suggests that the spatial conductance changes occur only in the range of bias voltage , corresponding to the opening of the gap , asserting the locally varying electronic behavior in the film with the formation of the superconducting phase . \n our measurements suggest that the effect of the disordered electron scattering on the superconducting phase is to produce concurrent conductance fluctuations at energies close to the superconducting energy gap at the beat positions of the charge density modulations . \n the zero field data imply that the superconducting conductance curves deviates from the s - wave bcs - like behavior , with reduced quasi - particle peaks . \n these are typical sts observations close to the superconductor to insulator transition in the disordered films . \n therefore we believe the spatial changes in the local properties in the superconductins phase reflect a displacement of electronic states , and the total amount of states remains roughly the same in the normal state , at the energy range studied here . \n these observations may be extended to the other disordered superconducting films . \n [ [ v -

particle peaks shown in blue color are at zero magnetic field , and with the increase in the field to 1.5 t , the peaks are suppressed , and disappear at 4 t. in the regions where quasiparticle peaks are absent , the conductance curves merely widen at higher fields upto 4 t. the conductance curve at 4 t also near uniformly shows a considerable reduced states near zero bias voltage in this film . in order to compare the changes at zero magnetic field , with respect to the conductance at 4 t , the normalized curves are shown in the panels , ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively for the representative curves in both the regions . with this procedure , \n the conductance curve at 4 t is brought to near unity at all the bias voltage values , and the relative differences are seen . at 1.5 t in panel ( c ) and ( d ) , the increase in the conductance is about equal mangitude for both the regions . \n this observation points out that at 0 t , on the background of the nearly equal average conductance ( i.e. , at 4 t ) , the quasi - particle peaks develop with different heights , while forming the superconducting phase in this film . \n it also relates to the spatial map of the average conductance in fig . \n 2(e ) , showing a slightly higher contrast in the central region , and a sharper edge in the histogram peak shown in its inset . the panel ( e ) in fig . \n 4 shows the conductance behavior at 4 t , in the bias voltage range from -60 mv to + 60 mv , at t = 0.15 k. the tunneling conductance monotonically reduces as zero bias votage is approached , and the peculiar variation on the logarithmic scale , shown in the inset , has perfectly linear behavior . in panel ( f ) \n we show at the selected magnetic fields between 0 t to 5 t , the zero bias conductance in the curves at 100 mk . \n the initial increase in the zero bias conductance is gradual , whereas a saturation behavior is observed above 2.5 t. the slope of this curve is plotted in the inset , and a peak in the slope is seen , marked as @xmath19 , at 2.5 t. this value is very close to the estimated @xmath20 from the resistance measurements in tin film suggesting that the conductance at 4 t , and onwards corresponds to the normal phase of the tin film . \n another significant observation that the variation of the conductance is logarithmic relates to the long range coulomb electron - electron repulsion being enhanced in the quasi-2d films of tin due to the presence of disorder@xcite . \n our measurement asserts that the cooper pairing emerges out of an electronic structure with a strongly reduced density of states at the fermi level . \n remarkably , the energy range for this reduction coincides with the superconducting gap . \n the reduced tunneling conductance features far from bcs s - wave theory can also be related to strongly reduced electronic states close to the fermi level \n . we do not observe such visible spatial changes at high magnetic fields to be able to relate to the inhomogenieties in the superconducting phase . \n however , the specral map of the average conductance at 0 t ( for e.g. , panel ( f ) in figure 2 ) indicates towards a reasonable variations in the density of states even in the normal state . \n [ [ discussions - and - conclusions ] ] discussions and conclusions + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    though the microscopic origin of the disorder needs substantial studies of the sample properties at the nanoscale , the possible role of crystalline boundaries or the impurities from the precursors during sample preparation ( chlorine impurities in the case of ald deposited tin films ) as well as partial oxidation of the surface in the ambient atmosphere can not be ruled out . \n charge density modulations observed at the crystalline boundaries ( figure s2 ) suggest that the microscopic drive towards the disorder induced insulating like phase might set in locally by the inelastic scattering in some areas of the film . at the same time the diffusive motion of electrons \n sets up the long range correlation of the charge density modulations . \n zero bias anomaly in the tin film in the normal state relates to the disorder enhanced repulsive coulomb interaction which leads to deviation of the bcs gap in the clean superconducting tin film . \n clearly determination of the superconducting gap is difficult in these films as the tunneling spectra contain information on both the pairing and repulsive interactions . \n the spatial inhomogeneities in the superconducting gap are therefore difficult to establish in the 2d disordered thin films . \n the spatial positions where the quasi - particle peaks are suppressed but possibly the superconducting gap still surviving may be interpreted as a result of the phase fluctuations . this indicates a possibility of localization of cooper pairs in these regions , amid a general bosonic character of the remaining of the film . with further increase in the disorder we expect the zero bias anomaly to pronounce and the superconducting gap will further reduce@xcite . close to the sit , \n the coulomb repulsion as well may become so strong that the percolation mechanism will cease to exist and the superconducting gap vanishes . \n the formation of the localized superconducting regions co - existing with the strongly disordered 2d - metallic phase across sit may be a very remote possibility . \n the complete suppression of the superconducting state at sit follows the loss of long range phase coherence in the entire film at a critical disorder and ascertains a fermionic mechanism . till now \n there is no experimental evidence for the superconducting gap to be present in the insulating side or whether the spatial inhomogeneity on the superconducting side will lead to a bose insulating phase across sit . \n however , in our results we find evidences of the regions of localized cooper pairs surrounded by the phase correlated superconducting areas . \n the interface of the two regions exhibit intermediate curves ( at bias voltage 0.4 mv in figure 3 ) with relatively energy independent density of states . \n our results assert the possibility of superconducting and bose insulating regions co - exististing if the local disorder and the charge density modulations segregates two behaviors in the 2d films . in conclusion \n the inhomogeneous superconducting phase was established in the disordered tin film as a result of phase fluctuations and evidences are provided for the localized bose insulating regions in the superconducting film . \n plane is shown as 0.42 nm . \n the panel ( b ) shows the surface image for the tin film . \n the crystallite sizes were estimated and presented in the form of the histogram shown in the inset . \n * c * stm topographic image over an area 10 x 10 nm taken at @xmath21mk in the superconducting tin thin film . \n the corresponding 2d -

phase representation and show that a precise definition of the phase operator requires a space discretisation in cells of size @xmath0 . \n we perform a systematic expansion of the hamiltonian in terms of two small parameters , the relative density fluctuations inside a cell and the phase change over a cell . \n the resulting macroscopic observables can be computed in one , two and three dimensions with no ultraviolet or infrared divergence . \n furthermore this approach exactly matches bogoliubov s approach when there is a true condensate . \n we give the resulting expressions for the equation of state of the gas , the ground state energy , the first order and second order correlations functions of the field . \n explicit calculations are done for homogeneous systems . \n recent progresses in the realization of low - dimensional bose gases in the quantum degenerate regime offer new perspectives for the comparison with theoretical treatments . in atomic bose gases , \n low - dimensional systems are achieved by creating anisotropic trapping potentials . \n bose - einstein condensates of reduced dimensionality , that is with the atomic motion frozen in the harmonic oscillator ground state along one or two directions , have been produced @xcite . \n low - dimensional bose gases have been the subject of early theoretical studies . in the thermodynamical limit for spatially homogeneous systems , the mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem @xcite excludes the formation of a bose - einstein condensate at finite temperature . \n this is physically due to large phase fluctuations which restrict the coherence length of the bosonic field to a finite value . \n one expects however that strong enough repulsive interactions between the particles strongly reduces the density fluctuations of the gas in contrast to the non - interacting case @xcite . in this context , \n popov introduced a long time ago the concept of _ quasi - condensate _ \n @xcite . \n this concept has been extended to trapped gases @xcite . \n the recent observation of large phase fluctuations for a degenerate bose gas in a highly anisotropic cigar shaped trap has brought a qualitative experimental confirmation of the theory in a quasi one - dimensional geometry @xcite . \n it turns out that the theory of quasi - condensates has not reached yet the maturity of the theory for condensates . in the case of regular 3d bose - einstein condensation in the weakly interacting regime , \n the bogoliubov theory @xcite , based on a systematic expansion in a small parameter , gives a very precise description of the state of the gas . \n the intuitive idea of the bogoliubov theory is to use the existence of a single macroscopically occupied mode @xmath1 of the field , the mode of the condensate . \n we recall here the @xmath2-symmetry preserving version of the theory @xcite . \n one first splits the bosonic field operator as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 annihilates a particle in the condensate mode and @xmath5 accounts for quantum and thermal fluctuations in the other modes . \n then one uses the assumption @xmath6 to solve perturbatively the field equations of motion . \n this approach is not suitable for a _ quasi - condensate _ as there is no single macroscopically occupied field mode . \n fortunately , in the case of weak density fluctuations , the bogoliubov idea can still be adapted in a quantum phase - density representation of the field operator . \n one writes the field operator @xmath7 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are position dependent operators giving the phase and the density . \n one then splits the operator giving the density as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a c - number and @xmath13 are fluctuations , and one uses the fact that @xmath14 . \n this idea has already been used in the literature @xcite but to our knowledge without a precise definition of the phase operator , a well - known delicate point of quantum field theory @xcite . as a consequence of the non - rigorous definition of the phase , divergences appear in the theory @xcite : one has to introduce an arbitrary energy cut - off , so that predictions in 1d at zero temperature are made within a logarithmic accuracy only , and in 3d there is no full equivalence with the bogoliubov theory . another approach based on the current - density operator rather than on the phase operator \n is given by schwartz @xcite : an expansion of the hamiltonian in terms of weak density and current fluctuations is performed relating the correlation function of the field to the static structure factor . \n it is subject to the same divergence problem in 2d and 3d in the absence of energy cut - off if one calculates the structure factor in the bogoliubov approximation . \n a possibility to circumvent these difficulties is to rely on the path integral formulation of quantum field theory , which involves a functional integral over a classical field , for which the phase is perfectly well defined . \n this is the approach used by popov , but with the introduction of an energy cut - off much smaller than the chemical potential of the gas , so that the physics at length scales smaller than the healing length is not accurately described . \n this functional integral approach has recently been revisited @xcite : it can lead to a cut - off independent formalism for quasi - condensates . \n the predictions of @xcite have the unsatisfactory feature of not reproducing exactly the same results as the bogoliubov theory for a 3d condensate , but this has been corrected in an erratum @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a new improved bogoliubov approach to treat _ quasi - condensates _ in the phase - density formalism for a weakly - interacting bose gas . \n this approach is based on a lattice model , that is with discrete spatial modes , which allows to give a careful definition of the phase operator of the field and to introduce from the start an energy cut - off . \n it uses a systematic expansion in powers of the density fluctuations and of the spatial phase gradient and leads to simple expressions for the first order and the second order spatial correlation functions of the bosonic field that do not depend on the energy cut - off and that exactly reproduces in 3d the predictions of the bogoliubov theory . \n we also use this formalism to determine the equation of state of the gas to the lowest non - vanishing order in the thermal and quantum excitations .    in section [ secnew ] , \n we construct a discretized space model in order to define in a precise way the operators giving the phase and the density . \n we give the physical implications of the space discretization , restricting this approach to highly degenerate and weakly interacting bose systems . in section [ modes ] , we derive a quadratic approximation to the hamiltonian , that is we derive approximate linear equations of motion for the density fluctuations and the phase operators . \n we recover to the lowest order the gross - pitaevskii equation for the _ quasi - condensate _ density and we recover the bogoliubov spectrum for the excitations . \n we also push the expansion to the next order , by producing a cubic correction to the quadratic hamiltonian , including the interaction between the _ quasi - condensate _ and the excitations . \n we show that inclusion of this correction is necessary to get a consistent theory and to establish the full equivalence between our approach and the number conserving bogoliubov theory . in section [ application ] , we present a few applications of our formalism : we give general formulas for the equation of state and the ground state of the gas , and for the first order and second order correlation functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the field operator . in section [ homogene ] \n , we apply our formal results to the homogeneous bose gas in various dimensions of space . \n this allows to derive simply the validity condition of the method and to compare with existing results in the literature .",
    "we present a technique for automatically weaving structural invariant checks into an existing collection of classes . using variations on existing design patterns \n , we use a concise specification to generate from this collection a new set of classes that implement the interfaces of the originals , but with the addition of user - specified class invariant checks . \n our work is notable in the scarcity of assumptions made . \n unlike previous design pattern approaches to this problem , our technique requires no modification of the original source code , relies only on single inheritance , and does not require that the attributes used in the checks be publicly visible . \n we are able to instrument a wide variety of class hierarchies , including those with pure interfaces , abstract classes and classes with type parameters . \n we have implemented the construction as an eclipse plug - in for java development .",

sham states . \n although , indirect lda band gaps reproduce the experimental trend of indirect optical band gaps  @xcite , direct lda band gaps deviate from experimental trends at small @xmath7 , where quantum confinement effects are expected to play an important role . \n second , band gaps display a discontinuity of @xmath280.2  ev for large @xmath7 , which is not observed in experiments . \n different choices of semi - local functionals or lattice constants ( e.g. experimental , relaxed or epitaxially strained ) display the same discontinuity , up to a rigid shift of  @xmath280.1  ev . \n the band gap discontinuity for large @xmath7 arises from the low - lying conduction states that are significant for large finite @xmath7 ( @xmath30 ) but are absent for @xmath33 ( see fig . \n [ fig : fig2](a ) ) . \n these states arise due to the distortion of the two ti atoms adjacent to the extra sro layers and the associated splitting of the local ti @xmath47 states . as shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig2](b ) for @xmath34 , the cbm wavefunction for large finite @xmath7 corresponds to two ti @xmath48 states localized at the tio@xmath9 layers next to the extra sro layers . \n the bands above the low - lying conduction states ( cbm@xmath36 ) are formed by @xmath49 ti d@xmath50 states that localize at the center of the perovskite layers ( see fig . \n [ fig : fig2](c ) ) . \n the energy difference between the cbm and cbm+2 converges to @xmath51  ev at large @xmath7 and leads to the discontinuity . \n the distortions at the extra sro layers localize the cbm ( vbm ) orbital at the edges ( center ) of the perovskite layers , leading to the quasi two - dimensional properties of the rp series . \n if the distortions are removed from the structure of @xmath7 by artificially aligning the sr and ti atoms with the o atoms , the cbm becomes a degenerate set of @xmath7 ti @xmath48 states and the cbm wavefunction recovers to an unconfined uniform distribution of @xmath48 states along the vertical direction ( see fig . \n [ fig : fig2](d ) ) . \n note that if the distortions are removed from the entire series , lda band gaps display a linear trend as a function of @xmath13 that deviates from experiments at large @xmath7 ( see lda@xmath52 in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] ) .     ( a ) \n direct and ( b ) indirect band gaps as a function of @xmath13 using different levels of theory . \n experimental values are taken from ref . \n @xcite ( black solid error bars ) and table  [ table : optical ] ( red dash error bars ) . ]    before discussing our _ ab initio _ mbpt results , we compare our lda results with hybrid functional calculations . as a function of @xmath13 ( fig .  [ \n fig : fig3 ] ) , hse06 band gaps are in good agreement with measured optical band gaps . \n however , this agreement , while good , is fortuitous , since the generalized kohn - sham system is formally unable to describe interacting two - particle states , e.g. excitons . \n trends in hse06 band gaps are well approximated by a rigid shift of lda band gaps , and in particular , underestimate by @xmath53  ev the experimental direct optical band gap of @xmath8 , where electron - electron and electron - hole interaction effects are expected to be important . \n lcc    l +   + this work + @xmath25(gpp)/lda + @xmath25(ff)/lda + prev . \n work + @xmath25/lda + @xmath25/lda + @xmath25/lda+u + @xmath25/lda + expts . \n +    cc    c srtio@xmath3 +    cc    c @xmath17 +   + 3.90 + 3.86 +   + 3.76 + 3.80 + 3.77 +   + 3.30 +    &    c @xmath18 +   + 3.57 + 3.52 +   +   + 3.40 + 3.28 + 3.32 +   +    &    c sr@xmath9tio@xmath10 +    cc    c @xmath17 +   + 4.17 + 4.21 +   +   +   +   +   +   +    &    c @xmath18 +   + 4.02 + 4.06 +   +   +   +   +   +   +    l ref . \n +   +   +   +   +   + @xcite + @xcite + @xcite + @xcite + @xcite +    [ table : electronic ]    we now turn to our results with _ ab initio _ mbpt . \n table  [ table : electronic ] shows fundamental band gaps for cubic srtio@xmath3 and @xmath8 calculated with @xmath25/lda . \n our @xmath25 calculations for cubic srtio@xmath3 are in line with previous @xmath4 results ( by @xmath54  ev ) but overestimate photoemission measurements ( by @xmath55  ev ) . \n full -

energy bse solution , \n the first peak arises primarily from direct transitions to the ti @xmath48 conduction band . \n the large energy difference ( 0.5  ev ) between the dominant first and third peak is explained by the large energy difference ( 0.9  ev ) between the cbm and the rest of the conduction bands . \n the first peak merges with the rest of the spectrum at a critical layer thickness @xmath58 , and the third peak becomes the spectrum onset at @xmath33 .    as @xmath7 increases , there is a large transfer of spectral weight toward small energies due to the decrease of dispersion along the @xmath46 line ( see fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ]  ( a ) ) . at the critical layer thickness @xmath59 , \n transitions to the cbm at the sro layers become negligible compared to transitions to the cbm@xmath36 at the center of the perovskite layers . as already suggested in ref . \n @xcite , the volume of the increasingly large region of connected octahedra dominates over the thin sro extra layers , and the spectrum approaches the spectrum of @xmath33 . \n experimentally , low - lying conduction states and excitonic effects become negligible due to limited resolution ( see fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ]  ( a ) ) and optical gaps converge continuously with increasing @xmath7 , explaining the absence of band gap discontinuity in the optical measurements ( see fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ]  ( a ) ) . \n the increase of exciton binding energy at small @xmath7 implies a spatial localization of the exciton of @xmath8 . as a means of visualizing the lowest singlet exciton , fig . \n [ fig : fig4](b)-(c ) shows the top and side views of an isosurface probability amplitude of finding an electron given a hole is fixed near the o atom . \n the exciton displays charge - transfer character and localizes , in the 2d plane defined by the lone tio@xmath9 layer . \n the real space wave function envelope of the exciton resembles the @xmath60 state of the 2d hydrogenic model and has an average radius of @xmath61  @xcite , with @xmath62 the bohr radius . \n our calculations show that the exciton binding energy is insensitive to epitaxial strain : while direct and indirect band gaps decrease linearly by  @xmath63  ev from tensile ( @xmath64% ) to compressive ( @xmath65% ) strain , the exciton binding energy varies by less than 10  mev in the same strain range . as @xmath7 increases , the exciton localizes on the tio@xmath9 layers next to the extra sro layer due to the distortions next to the sro layers .    in summary , \n we have used dft with different functionals , and the @xmath25/bse approach to compute quasiparticle and optical spectra of selected members of the sr@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 series . \n our @xmath25/bse direct and indirect optical gaps for the rp series are in excellent agreement with measured optical gaps when electron - hole interactions are included . \n we find that quantum confinement , induced by the extra sro layers in the rp series , produces a larger increase in quasiparticle band gaps , relative to trends in optical gaps . \n the exciton binding energy is significant and increases for small @xmath7 , reaching a value of 330  mev . \n the @xmath25/bse spectra reproduce the main experimental features and reveal excitonic structure near the gap edge . \n our work suggests that the rp series may be a useful framework for the study of dimensionality and quantum confinement in optoelectronic properties of complex oxides .",

the present experimental limit is @xmath10  gev from the cdf detector  @xcite and independently @xmath11  gev from the d0 detector  @xcite . \n the consistency of radiative corrections to all electroweak data however indicates that @xmath12  gev  @xcite , and hence that the top quark can probably be discovered at the fermilab tevatron @xmath2 collider sooner or later  @xcite . here \n the sm predicts mainly @xmath0 pair production via qcd with @xmath13 decays ; the smallest and cleanest signals are expected in two - lepton channels  @xcite , but larger single - lepton  @xcite and all - jet  @xcite signals can also in principle be separated from backgrounds . since the top signals will initially ( and perhaps for a considerable time ) be based on a small number of events , it will be important to suppress the backgrounds as far as possible in ways that do not seriously reduce the signals . in this note \n we propose the use of event - shape criteria to distinguish the top signal and reduce backgrounds in the relatively copious single - lepton - plus-4jet channel . \n the underlying idea is that tevatron @xmath0 production will be mainly near threshold in the cm frame of the lowest - order qcd subprocesses @xmath14 or @xmath15 , and hence will mostly lead to rather spherical event shapes in this frame . \n phase - space factors favor spherical configurations ; the @xmath0 spin correlations  @xcite and decay matrix elements introduce substructure but do not drastically change this spherical tendency , which can help to distinguish the signal from backgrounds . \n this idea is very familiar in the context of heavy quark searches at @xmath16 colliders and has recently been applied to 6-jet top signals at the tevatron  @xcite ; we propose here to apply it to lepton - neutrino-4jet signals from @xmath17 decays ( where the neutrino is partially measured via transverse energy balance ) . backgrounds in this channel from @xmath18- and @xmath19-quark semileptonic decays can be removed by lepton @xmath20 and isolation cuts  @xcite . \n the major background then comes from @xmath1 production plus 4 qcd jets , which remains comparable with the signal after all the usual cuts on transverse momenta @xmath20 , pseudo - rapidities @xmath21 , and missing transverse energy @xmath22 \n @xcite ; we neglect contributions from @xmath23 or @xmath24 plus 2 qcd jets  @xcite that are an order of magnitude smaller . \n this background can be further suppressed by requiring a @xmath18-jet - tag , costing the signal a tagging - efficiency factor of order 0.3 at present  @xcite . \n alternatively , we may expect the inherent collinear singularities to cause spatial correlations of qcd jets with each other and with the beam axis , giving less spherical configurations and hence a discrimination between background and signal via an appropriate choice of event - shape variable as follows . \n first we restrict ourselves to momenta in the transverse plane , in order to use the most direct neutrino information contained in its transverse momentum defined by @xmath25 . \n we consider the usual  circularity \" event shape variable @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 summed over the lepton , neutrino , and 4  jet transverse momenta and minimized with respect to the choice of the unit vector @xmath28 . \n this quadratic variable is unstable against the splitting or combining of jets ; although @xmath26 is well defined for any given jet algorithm , it would be theoretically preferable to use a linearized variable such as @xmath29 both @xmath26 and @xmath30 are normalized to 1 for an ideal circular event and vanish for a linear configuration . \n next we consider event shapes in three dimensions . \n the longitudinal neutrino momentum @xmath31 is not measured ; it can be inferred approximately by requiring that the lepton - neutrino invariant mass @xmath32 , but this leaves a two - fold ambiguity . \n we choose the solution that allows the most consistent @xmath0 reconstruction ( details below ) and form the conventional normalized @xmath33 momentum tensor @xmath34 from the lepton plus neutrino plus 4jet momenta @xmath35 , in the cm frame of these momenta . \n @xmath36 has three eigenvalues @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 ; the sphericity @xmath40 and aplanarity @xmath41 are then defined by @xmath42 and @xmath43 . \n ( it would be theoretically preferable to use linearized variables such as thrust and acoplanarity , but for ease of computation we use @xmath40 and @xmath41 here ) . \n thus @xmath44 for ideal spherical events , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for plane circular events , and @xmath47 for linear events . \n we therefore expect the tevatron top signal to give typically larger @xmath48 and @xmath41 than the @xmath49jets background , and have made quantitative parton - level calculations at @xmath50  tev to confirm this .    for illustration \n we compute the @xmath51 production and decay distributions in lowest order with full spin correlation effects  @xcite , using the mrs set @xmath52 parton distributions of ref . \n @xcite evaluated at scale @xmath53 , neglecting possible additional qcd jets and taking @xmath54jet final states . \n the total @xmath0 production rate is normalized conservatively to the central value of ref . \n @xcite , although values about 20% higher have recently been proposed  @xcite . \n we calculate the @xmath55jet background from the full tree - level matrix elements following ref . \n @xcite , evaluating the parton distributions at scale @xmath56 in accord with tevatron results  @xcite . \n we sum lepton flavors and charges @xmath57 . \n we simulate calorimeter errors by gaussian uncertainties on jet and lepton energies , following the cdf values tabulated in ref . \n @xcite , and calculate the apparent neutrino @xmath20 from overall @xmath58 imbalance . \n we impose the following acceptance cuts on transverse momenta , pseudorapidities , and jet multiplicity @xmath59 , selecting regions where the top signal should be strong , @xmath60 we also set minimum jet - jet and lepton - jet separations @xmath61 where @xmath62 , to mimic some effects of jet - finding algorithms and lepton isolation cuts  @xcite . \n we note that these @xmath63 cuts already introduce some event - shape discrimination . \n we first compare the shapes of the @xmath48 and @xmath41 distributions for @xmath0 signal and @xmath64  jets background , for the case @xmath65  gev . \n the means @xmath66 and standard deviations @xmath67 for the signal ( background ) are @xmath68 from which we see that the circularity variables offer little discrimination in this case , whereas the @xmath40 and @xmath41 variables show appreciable displacements between signal and background . \n the @xmath40 and @xmath41 distributions are shown in fig . \n [ s , a dist ] . \n we see that the signal has significantly different distributions from the background , expecially for @xmath41 ; this could help to validate an eventual top signal ( extracted by @xmath18-tagging say ) . \n alternatively , cutting out events below a minimum value @xmath69 or @xmath70 would reduce the background more than the signal ; integrated cross sections for @xmath71 and @xmath72 are shown in fig . \n [ sigma min ] . \n we shall illustrate below the effects of a choice @xmath73 ( not specifically optimized ) , similar to cuts suggested for all - jet signals  @xcite ; this reduces the signal ( background ) by 15% ( 36% ) , giving a cleaner result and an increase in its statistical significance ( signal)/@xmath74 .    to extract a top quark mass peak , we introduce a constrained event parameterization as follows . \n we first compute the two solutions for @xmath31 by requiring @xmath32 ; if they are formally complex , we set the imaginary parts to zero , getting the single nearest - to - onshell solution . \n we then select the pair of jets with invariant mass closest to @xmath75 , and identify them as the @xmath76 decay candidates . \n the remaining two jets are candidates for @xmath18 and @xmath77 jets , if this is a @xmath0 event . from the four possible ways of pairing the latter two jets with our unique @xmath76 choice and the two - fold @xmath78 solution , we select \n whichever pairing gives the closest agreement between the resultant @xmath79 invariant masses . \n the mean of these two closest @xmath80 values is defined as the reconstructed top mass @xmath81 ( following the notation of ref . \n @xcite ) ; taking the mean gives a narrower signal peak than either the semileptonic or the hadronic @xmath80 value separately . \n our @xmath81 variable differs from those proposed in refs . \n @xcite . \n figure  [ tilde m ] presents the calculated @xmath81 distribution for signal and background , for @xmath82 , 150 , and 170  gev , first with the standard acceptance cuts of eqs . \n ( [ accept])([sep ] ) ( upper curves ) , and also with the additional event - shape cuts @xmath83 ( lower curves ) . \n hadronization effects have not been included , except in their contributions to calorimeter resolution ; we expect they will somewhat further smear the @xmath81 peak . \n our results show that    1 . \n @xmath40 and @xmath41 distributions of top signals differ significantly from background in the lepton + neutrino + 4jets channel ; 2 . \n these differences could help to validate an eventual top signal or alternatively reduce background and improve significance ; 3 . \n the signal would peak in our reconstructed top mass variable @xmath81 . \n event shape criteria have previously proved promising in the 6jet channel  @xcite ;

    "the heating of electrons in collisionless magnetic reconnection is explored in particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations with non - zero guide fields so that electrons remain magnetized . in this \n regime electric fields parallel to @xmath0 accelerate particles directly while those perpendicular to @xmath0 do so through gradient-@xmath1 and curvature drifts . \n the curvature drift drives parallel heating through fermi reflection while the gradient @xmath1 drift changes the perpendicular energy through betatron acceleration . \n we present simulations in which we evaluate each of these mechanisms in space and time in order to quantify their role in electron heating . for a case with a small guide field ( 20 % of the magnitude of the reconnecting component ) \n the curvature drift is the dominant source of electron heating . \n however , for a larger guide field ( equal to the magnitude of the reconnecting component ) electron acceleration by the curvature drift is comparable to that of the parallel electric field . in both cases \n the heating by the gradient @xmath1 drift is negligible in magnitude . \n it produces net cooling because the conservation of the magnetic moment and the drop of @xmath1 during reconnection produce a decrease in the perpendicular electron energy . \n heating by the curvature - drift dominates in the outflow exhausts where bent field lines expand to relax their tension and is therefore distributed over a large area . \n in contrast , the parallel electric field is localized near x - lines . \n this suggests that acceleration by parallel electric fields may play a smaller role in large systems where the x - line occupies a vanishing fraction of the system . the curvature drift and the parallel electric field \n dominate the dynamics and drive parallel heating . \n a consequence is that the electron energy spectrum becomes extremely anisotropic at late time , which has important implications for quantifying the limits of electron acceleration due to synchrotron emission . \n an upper limit on electron energy gain that is substantially higher than earlier estimates is obtained by balancing reconnection drive with radiative loss .",

    "the discovery of superconductivity in magnesium diborate ( mgb@xmath0 ) has stimulated great interest in the search of new superconductors with similar lattice structures . \n unlike cuprate or iron - based superconductors , mgb@xmath0 is indisputably a phonon - mediated high temperature superconductor . \n the emergence of high temperature superconductivity in this material results from the strong coupling between the boron @xmath1-bonding electrons around the fermi level and the bond - stretching optical phonon modes . \n here we show , based on the first - principles calculations , that li@xmath0b@xmath2c is such a good candidate of superconductor whose superconducting transition temperature ( t@xmath3 ) might be even higher than mgb@xmath0 . \n li@xmath0b@xmath2c consists of alternating graphene - like boron - carbon layers and boron - boron layers with intercalated lithium atoms between them . \n similar to mgb@xmath0 , li@xmath0b@xmath2c is inherently metallic and possesses two @xmath1- and two @xmath4-electron bands around the fermi energy . \n the superconducting pairs are glued predominately by the strong interaction between boron @xmath1-bonding electrons and various optical phonon modes . \n a @xmath1-bond in graphite or other materials is a strong covalent bond of a spin singlet pair formed by two electrons with opposite spins . in \n most of materials , a @xmath1-bond is a stable bound state whose energy sinks well below the fermi level , making no contribution to the conductivity . \n however , if the energy of a @xmath1-bond is lifted up to the fermi level by hole doping or other effects , the binding force of the bond is released and electrons become itinerant . the characteristic feature of the @xmath1-bond can nevertheless be retained if its hybridization with other conducting electrons is small . since the coupling between @xmath1-electrons and lattice vibrations is generally very large , this may generate a strong attractive interaction to pair electrons to a high - t@xmath3 superconducting state . \n this is just the physics underlying the 39 k superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 discovered by akimitsu and coworkers in 2000@xcite . \n this picture was supported by the density functional theory and lattice dynamics calculation , which shows that the electron - phonon interaction between the @xmath1 bands and bond - stretching optical phonon modes @xcite plays a central role in the superconducting pairing in mgb@xmath0 , and was further confirmed by the isotope effect measurement @xcite . \n stimulated by the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 , great effort has been made to find new phonon - mediated bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superconductors during the past decade , focused on chemically substituted mgb@xmath0 @xcite or layered compounds similar to mgb@xmath0 @xcite . among them \n the hole - doped libc with 50% li deficiency has attracted particular interest . \n libc is isostructural and isovalent to mgb@xmath0 , with alternatively stacked graphene - like boron - carbon layers intercalated between li layers @xcite . without doping , \n libc is a large gap semiconductor with a boron - carbon @xmath1 band at the top of valance band@xcite . \n if this @xmath1 band can be rigidly lifted up to cross the fermi level by hole doping , it was found by the first principle calculation that the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath5 , which again contributes predominantly by the coupling between the @xmath1-electrons and the boron - carbon bond - stretching modes , is about 1.8 times larger than in mgb@xmath0 . \n based on this calculation , it was predicted that li@xmath6bc could be a high - t@xmath3 superconductor with a transition temperature about 100 k.@xcite however , the superconductivity has never been observed in hole - doped li@xmath7bc@xcite . \n the reason is that the hole doping by creating li deficiency introduces strong lattice distortion to both li and boron - carbon layers , which changes completely the band structure of libc and diminishes the wish to lift the @xmath1-band up to the fermi level.@xcite li@xmath6bc remains in a semiconducting phase . \n b@xmath2c*.

    "using unreliable or noisy components for reliable communication requires error correction . but which noise processes can support information transmission , and which are too destructive ? for classical systems any channel whose output depends on its input has the capacity for communication , but the situation is substantially more complicated in the quantum setting . \n we find a generic test for incapacity based on any suitable forbidden transformation  a protocol for communication with a channel passing our test would also allow us to implement the associated forbidden transformation . \n our approach includes both known quantum incapacity tests  positive partial transposition ( ppt ) and antidegradability ( no cloning)as special cases , putting them both on the same footing . \n we also find a physical principle explaining the nondistillability of ppt states : any protocol for distilling entanglement from such a state would also give a protocol for implementing the forbidden time - reversal operation . \n understanding how to use communication resources optimally is a major part of information theory @xcite . \n usually , a sender and receiver have access to repeated uses of a noisy communication channel and want to use error correction to introduce redundancy into their messages , making them less susceptible to noise . \n the capacity of a channel , measured in bits per channel use , is the best rate that can be achieved with vanishing probability of transmission error in the limit of many channel uses . \n quantum information theory expands the notions of both information and noise to include quantum effects @xcite . \n indeed , a quantum channel has many different capacities , depending on what kind of information is to be transmitted , and what other resources are available . \n for example , the classical capacity of a quantum channel is the best rate for transmitting classical information , the private capacity relates to quantum cryptography , and the quantum capacity is the best rate for coherent communication of quantum systems . \n this last , which establishes the fundamental limits on quantum error correcting codes , will be our main concern here . \n in contrast to the simple capacity formula of classical information theory , finding the quantum capacity of a quantum channel is in general intractable . the formula for the quantum capacity @xcite of a channel involves a maximization over states on tensor products of an arbitrary number of uses of the channel . \n no bound on the size of this maximization is yet known . \n even the _ classical _ capacity of a quantum channel has this problem @xcite . \n we will consider the simpler incapacity question : which channels have nonzero quantum capacity , and which do nt ? \n this is still very hard to answer , but there are two known criteria for showing a channel has no capacity . \n the first , a mathematical condition called the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion , is due to @xcite . \n the second , due to @xcite , gives a condition for when quantum capacity would imply a violation of the no - cloning principle @xcite . \n adding to the complexity of the zero - quantum - capacity channels is the existence of the superactivation phenomenon , where two zero - capacity channels interact synergistically to jointly generate capacity @xcite . \n a particular consequence of this phenomenon is that the set of zero - capacity quantum channels is not convex . \n unfortunately , there is no simple test to determine , given its parameters , whether a channel can transmit quantum information . \n we will address the incapacity question from an abstract point of view . \n our arguments require only the existence of physical states and maps , as well as the existence of a suitable forbidden ( or unphysical ) map on the states . \n one motivation of this work is to understand incapacity of quantum channels , but our approach is sufficiently general to include such things as generalized probabilistic theories @xcite as well as the discrete quantum mechanics of @xcite . \n our findings will also apply to classical systems with proscribed operations .",

lying excited eigenstate using a single fixed - size source smearing . \n the superposition of states manifested itself as a smearing dependence of the effective mass . in this letter \n we exploit this sensitivity to isolate the energy eigenstates .    in fig.[fig : \n mass_and_eig_for_3.12.26.35_q1 ] , we show the mass from the projected correlation functions and from the eigenvalues ( as shown in ref . \n @xcite ) for the fourth combination ( 3,12,26,35 ) of @xmath39 matrices . \n we note that similar results in mass from the projected correlation functions and the eigenvalues are observed in this analysis as in ref .  @xcite . \n though the mass of the first excited state from projected correlation functions show little change with variational parameters , see fig.[fig : mass_and_eig_for_3.12.26.35_q1 ] , the second and third excited states start a little below which indicates @xmath17 and @xmath20 are not sufficiently large . \n with larger euclidean times fewer states will contribute significantly to the correlators . \n the robust aspect of fitting projected correlators is manifest in fig.[fig : mass_and_eig_for_3.12.26.35_q1 ] , and reflects the stability of the eigenvectors against changes in @xmath17 and @xmath20 . \n in contrast , the mass from the eigenvalue analysis shows significant dependence on the variational parameters . the same method as described in ref . \n @xcite is applied in this letter to extract the mass from the projected correlation functions .    in fig.[fig : mass_for_all_combinations_q1 ] , masses extracted from all the combinations of @xmath39 matrices ( from @xmath42 to @xmath43 ) are shown for the pion mass of 797 mev . some dependence of the excited states on smearing count is also observed here as in ref . \n @xcite for a few of the interpolator basis smearing sets . \n however the ground and first excited states are robust against changes in the interpolator basis , providing evidence that an energy eigenstate has been isolated . \n it should be noted that the highest excited state ( the third excited state ) is influenced more by the level of smearing than the lower excited states . \n this is to be expected as this state must accommodate all remaining spectral strength . \n the @xmath44 combination in fig.[fig : mass_for_all_combinations_q1 ] provides heavier excited states as this basis begins with a low number of smearing sweeps ( a sweep count of 1 ) and also contains another low smearing set of 7 sweeps . \n the second and third excited states , and more importantly , the first excited state sits a bit high in comparison with the other bases . \n hence , extracting masses with this basis is not as reliable as other sets . \n the @xmath45 combination also contains elements with a small smearing sweep count ( 3 and 7 ) , hence this basis also provides heavier excited states and shows some systematic drift in the second excited state . however , this basis has reduced contamination from the excited states when compared with the first basis . \n the @xmath46 combination also starts at the low smearing count , so the mass from this basis for the third excited state is a little high . \n we can observe at this point that including basis elements with a low smearing count will increase the masses of excited states ( for instance , consecutive low numbers of smearing sweeps 1,7 and 3,7 , respectively ) . \n this is because the correlation functions with these low sweep counts have a large overlap with several heavier excited states in their sub - leading exponential . \n we also observe that the inclusion of basis elements with a high level of smearing ( for instance , a sweep count of 48 ) results in larger statistical errors in the analysis . \n the @xmath47 combination starts from a moderate smearing sweep count ( 12 ) and also contains elements with consecutive smearing sweep counts which provides less diversity in the basis . \n similarly , the @xmath48 combination contains consecutive large smearing sweep counts of 35 and 48 and operators for these levels of smearing are very similar challenging the isolation of single energy eigenstates . \n the @xmath49 and @xmath50 combinations are well spread over the given range of smearing sweeps and start from a sweep count of 3 . \n they do nt include successive lower smearing sweep counts . \n the @xmath51 combination contains the basis element with a sweep count of 48 but has only slightly larger statistical errors than the @xmath49 basis choice . \n both these bases provide diversity . \n it is observed that both combinations provide consistent results for the states . \n nonetheless , it should be noted that the @xmath46 to @xmath52 combinations all provide very consistent results for the lower three ( ground , first and second ) energy states , shown in fig.[fig : mass_for_all_combinations_q1 ] . \n while the @xmath45 and the @xmath53 excited states display some evidence of eigenstate mixing , the ground and the @xmath42 excited states are robust in this analysis as they agree within one standard deviation for all the combinations of @xmath39 matrices . \n hence , an analysis is performed to calculate the systematic errors associated with the choice of basis over the preferred four combinations ( from @xmath46 to @xmath52 ) with @xmath54 , where , @xmath55 is the number of bases , in this case is equal to 4 . \n it should be noted that for the ground and first excited states the systematic errors associated with choice of basis are very small in comparison with their statistical errors ( see table [ table : table.mpi.mavg.err - sum - over - qudrature.4comb.4states ] ) .            in fig.[fig \n : paper_m.avg_4com.x1x1.4x4.sqrt_erravg_4combs_errbasis_4combs.4states.allq.new ] , the masses from projected correlation functions are shown for all pion masses averaged over four combinations of correlation matrices ( from @xmath46 to @xmath52 ) . \n masses are averaged over these four bases and errors ( average statistical errors over these four bases and systematic errors associated with basis choices ) are combined in quadrature , @xmath56 . \n eigenstate mixing may be affecting the results for the second and the third excited states . \n the ground and the @xmath44 excited states systematically approach the physical mass of the nucleon and roper state . \n this is the first time evidence of a low - lying roper state has appeared from variational analysis near the chiral regime .    in fig.[fig : \n paper_m.avg_4com.x1x1.4x4.sqrt_erravg_4combs_errbasis_4combs.2states.allq.new ] , the ground and the first excited states of fig.[fig : paper_m.avg_4com.x1x1.4x4.sqrt_erravg_4combs_errbasis_4combs.4states.allq.new ] are shown in larger scale for clarity . \n the non - interacting two particle p - wave @xmath57 is shown by the dashed line . \n it is interesting to note that the observed lattice roper state sits lower than the p - wave @xmath57 , indicative of attractive @xmath58 interactions producing a resonance at physical quark masses . \n the very consistent euclidean - time fit window for all the bases and for all the quark masses , noticeably the lower time of the fit as shown in table [ table : mass_roperstates_4combs ] , assist to identify the robust nature of the extracted roper state which comes at the same euclidean - time from the heaviest to the lightest quarks masses . \n there are quenched artifacts that will have significant influence on our results should we progress to lighter quark masses . \n not only are @xmath59 couplings different in quenched qcd , but there are also contributions from unphysical , degenerate p - wave @xmath60 two - particle states  @xcite . \n future calculations approaching the decay threshold should be done in full dynamical - fermion qcd .    in conclusion , through the use of a variety of smeared - smeared correlation functions in constructing the correlation matrix , the first positive parity excited state of the nucleon @xmath0 , the roper state , has been observed for the first time using the variational analysis . while the @xmath61 correlation matrix analysis of standard interpolators is insufficient to isolate these excited energy eigenstates of qcd  @xcite , using the new correlation matrix construction with smeared - smeared correlators \n enables us to extract the otherwise elusive roper state .",

    "the propagation of an initially localized perturbation via an interacting many - particle hamiltonian dynamics is investigated . \n we argue that the propagation of the perturbation can be captured by the use of a continuous - time random walk where a single particle is traveling through an active , fluctuating medium . employing two archetype ergodic many - particle systems , namely ( i ) a hard - point gas composed of two unequal masses and ( ii ) a fermi - pasta - ulam chain we demonstrate that the corresponding perturbation profiles coincide with the diffusion profiles of the single - particle lvy walk approach . \n the parameters of the random walk can be related through elementary algebraic expressions to the physical parameters of the corresponding test many - body systems . \n the transport properties of many - particle systems are of salient interest in diverse contexts , ranging from foundations of thermodynamics to the transduction of information on the nanoscale . \n the collective evolution of @xmath0 interacting particles creates a dynamical `` tissue , '' whose properties depend not only on the hamiltonian of the system , but also on the state of the system itself . \n an objective of primary interest is how the system responds to the perturbation that locally affects its dynamics . \n the answer then provides direct insight into collective energy , correlation , and information transport in extended nondissipative media @xcite . \n consider the situation of a many - particle system at microcanonical equilibrium , when at the initial time @xmath1 one of the particles receives some external local perturbation . \n the system gains a small amount of _ perturbation energy _ , which is conserved due to hamiltonian evolution of the system . \n however , the perturbation does spread as the perturbation energy is shared by a constantly growing number of particles . \n , while the second one is subjected to constant scattering , so that its velocity fluctuates . \n the duration of single flight , @xmath2 , is a random variable drawn from the probability density function @xmath3.,width=317 ]    one of the main features of the spreading is the _ \n finite _ velocity of perturbation propagation , @xmath4 @xcite . \n therefore , similar to relativistic diffusion theories @xcite , an effective `` light cone '' occurs @xcite , such that at the given time @xmath5 the perturbation is almost completely confined to the interval @xmath6 $ ] @xcite . \n the fundamental fact of the cone s existence assumes the characteristics of a mathematical existence theorem @xcite ; its strength therefore is the generality when dealing with many - particle systems in rather arbitrary situations . \n a pronounced weakness of this mathematical approach , however , becomes evident whenever one attempts to implement the theory for a particular system to obtain qualitative results on an analytical level of description . \n therefore , more applied approaches , like the diffusion formalism , might become of beneficial use . \n indeed it is appealing to consider the said perturbation spreading as a certain ( not yet known ) one - dimensional diffusion process , and to quantify it with the mean square displacement and other related attributes @xcite . as it is known , however , it is impossible to describe this process by any known macroscopic , norm - preserving normal diffusion equation . \n conventional diffusion equations knowingly lead to infinite propagation speeds @xcite and therefore are incompatible with the existence of a causal cone . \n thus the perturbation kinetics should be ultimately considered on the microscopic level corresponding to the random walk approach .    with this letter \n we employ the microscopic single - particle random walk process in order to evaluate the evolution of perturbations in one - dimensional , ergodic many - particle systems . in doing \n so we address the two challenges : ( i ) how is the perturbation distributed within the cone , and ( ii ) what are the shapes of the cone fronts ? by using two renowned many - particle chains we demonstrate that the random walk model accurately describes the perturbation spreading in these _ interacting _ many - body systems . \n we show that the walker - media interactions are responsible for the observed shape of the causal cone and predict the universal scalings for the perturbation profile and its corresponding fronts .     for different times , @xmath7 . \n the dashed line depicts the propagator for the standard lvy walk with the constant flight velocity @xmath8 . for the simulations of the random walk in the active medium we employed the map ( [ eq : fluct ] ) with @xmath9 . \n the inset shows the ballistic front regions after the scaling transformation ( [ eq : scaling2 ] ) , where @xmath10.,scaledwidth=34.0% ]    _ model setup . _ \n the continuous -

particle systems has been attempted in @xcite . \n although this approach provided an adequate description for the perturbation spreading process , it failed to capture the dynamics of the cone fronts . the observed ballistic humps displayed smooth , gaussian - like profiles , with a scaling that was incompatible with the scaling behavior of deltalike peaks of the lw propagator @xcite .    in order to resolve this issue \n , we here extend the conventional ctrw setup by assuming that the walker performs a random walk through an _ active _ medium . \n conceptually , it means that while moving , the walker interacts with the surrounding medium ( the slab in fig . \n 1 ) . this interaction causes fluctuations of the walker s velocity ( note the noisy trajectory of the particle moving inside the slab in fig . \n 1 ) . \n the term `` active '' means that the medium is not solely dissipative and the particle not only continuously loses but also gains energy from its environment . \n both processes are in balance , yielding unbiased fluctuations of the walker s velocity around @xmath22 . \n _ model dynamics . \n _ we start out by considering a single flight event . \n the position of the walker is defined by a langevin equation @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a delta -

point gas @xcite . \n we performed a massive numerical experiment @xcite , yet even these efforts were not sufficient to cope with the statistical fluctuations [ note the thin green lines in figs . \n 4a , b ] . \n nevertheless , a relatively smooth shape of the ballistic hump allows for a convincing validation of the scaling ( [ eq : scaling2 ] ) . \n it is interesting to note that the velocity of the ballistic peaks is determined by the group velocity of effective thermal phonons @xcite , which , therefore can be associated with \n walkers  of the ctrw approach .     for the fpu dynamics with @xmath58 , @xmath74 and @xmath52 ( thin solid lines ) , compared to the propagators of the generalized lw model with @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( thick dashed lines ) . \n the scaling exponent is @xmath53 . \n the fpu profiles have been obtained by averaging over @xmath77 realizations . \n ( c ) energy correlation functions for the fpu system with @xmath78 for the time @xmath79 and different values of the energy per particle @xmath54.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    the perturbation profiles for different values of the energy per particle @xmath54 reveal another remarkable feature : the central part of profiles is independent of @xmath54 , while the ballistic humps move as @xmath54 increases , see fig . 4c . \n such behavior can be derived from the scaling invariance ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) . \n taking into account that @xmath33 , one can infer that the central part of the lw propagator is invariant under variation of @xmath22 when @xmath80 .    in conclusion \n , we demonstrated that the collective process of perturbation spreading across two celebrated _ many - particle _ \n systems , a hard - point gas and a fermi - pasta - ulam lattice , is reproduced by a _ \n single - particle _ stochastic process . \n it is intuitive that an ergodic dynamics is a prerequisite for the diffusionlike perturbation evolution . in integrable many -

    "we present measurements of the inclusive branching fractions for the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 , using 281 pb@xmath2 of data collected on the @xmath3 resonance with the cleo - c detector . \n we find @xmath4 and @xmath5 . \n using the known @xmath6 meson lifetimes , we obtain the ratio @xmath7 , confirming isospin invariance at the level of 3% . \n the positron momentum spectra from @xmath8 and @xmath9 have consistent shapes . \n the study of inclusive @xmath6 semileptonic decays is important for several reasons . \n first , by comparing the inclusive branching fractions of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons with the sum of the measured exclusive branching fractions , one can determine whether there are unobserved semileptonic decay modes . \n previous data suggest that the lightest vector and pseudoscalar resonances saturate the hadronic spectra @xcite \n . this may be due to the relatively low momentum of the daughter @xmath10 quark , that favors the formation of s - wave hadrons . \n alternatively , this may be an indication that heavy quark effective theory may still be valid at the charm quark mass scale @xcite . \n in addition , since accurate experimental determinations of the @xmath9 and @xmath8 lifetimes are available @xcite , measurements of semileptonic branching fractions determine the corresponding semileptonic widths , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . \n these widths are expected to be equal , modulo small corrections introduced by electromagnetic effects . \n weak annihilation diagrams can produce more dramatic effects on the cabibbo suppressed partial widths @xcite . \n as these contributions may also influence the extraction of @xmath13 from inclusive @xmath14 meson semileptonic decays , it is important to understand them well . finally , better knowledge of the inclusive positron spectra can be used to improved modeling of the `` cascade '' decays @xmath15 and thus is important in several measurements of @xmath16 decays . \n the use of ratios of semileptonic branching fractions as a probe of relative lifetimes of the @xmath6 mesons was suggested by pais and treiman @xcite . \n indeed the early measurements of the ratio of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 semileptonic branching fractions gave the first surprising evidence for the lifetime difference between these two charmed mesons @xcite . \n later , the first measurement of the individual charged and neutral @xmath6 inclusive semileptonic branching fractions was performed by mark iii @xcite , with an overall relative error of about 12 - 16% on the individual branching fractions , and 19% on their ratio . the inclusive decay @xmath17 was subsequently studied by argus @xcite and cleo @xcite , using the angular correlation between the @xmath18 emitted in a @xmath19 decay and the @xmath20 emitted in the subsequent @xmath21 decay . \n the more precise cleo result has a 5% relative error , dominated by systematic uncertainties . \n our measurements exploit a clean @xmath22 sample at threshold , and thus achieves significantly smaller systematic errors , through low backgrounds and well understood efficiencies . \n we use a 281 pb@xmath2 data sample , collected at the @xmath23 center - of - mass energy ( @xmath24 3.73 gev ) , with the cleo - c detector @xcite . \n this detector includes a tracking system composed of a six - layer low - mass drift chamber and a 47-layer central drift chamber , measuring charged particle momentum and direction , a state of the art csi(tl ) electromagnetic calorimeter , and a ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) hadron identification system . \n all these components are critical to an efficient and highly selective electron and positron identification algorithm . \n the charged particle momentum resolution is approximately 0.6% at 1 gev . \n the csi(tl ) calorimeter measures the electron and photon energies with a resolution of 2.2% at @xmath25 gev and 5% at @xmath26=100 mev , which , combined with the excellent tracking system , provides one of the @xmath27 identification variables , @xmath28 , where @xmath26 is the energy measured in the calorimeter and @xmath29 is the momentum measured in the tracking system . \n the tracking system provides charged particle discrimination too , through the measurement of the specific ionization @xmath30 . \n charged particles are also identified over most of their momentum range in the rich detector @xcite . in particular , \n rich identification plays a crucial role at momenta where the specific ionization bands of two particle species cross each other and @xmath30 does not provide any discrimination power . \n we use a tagging technique similar to the one pioneered by the mark iii collaboration @xcite . \n details on the tagging selection procedure are given in ref . \n @xcite . \n we select events containing either the decay @xmath31 or the decay @xmath32 . \n we use only these modes , because they have very low background . note that charge conjugate modes are implied throughout this paper . in this analysis \n we exploit the flavor information provided by the tagging @xmath6 : the @xmath33 charge sign provides a flavor tag , whereas the charge of the tag daughter @xmath34 is used for @xmath35 flavor assignment . \n we analyze all the recorded events at the @xmath3 and retain the events that contain at least one candidate @xmath36 or @xmath37 . \n two kinematic variables are used to select these candidates : the beam - constrained mass , @xmath38 , and the energy difference @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , where @xmath41 represents the beam energy and @xmath42 represent the 4-vectors of the candidate daughters . for @xmath35 tags , \n the measured standard deviations ( @xmath43 ) in @xmath39 and @xmath44 are @xmath45 mev and @xmath46 mev , while for @xmath47 tags , @xmath48 mev and @xmath49 mev . \n we select events that are within 3 @xmath43 of the expected @xmath39 ( 0 gev ) and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) for the channels considered . in order to determine the total number of tags , we count the events within the selected @xmath39-@xmath44 intervals \n ; then we subtract the combinatoric background inferred from two @xmath52 sideband regions on both sides of the @xmath53 signal peak , with a @xmath54 gap from the signal interval . \n the yields in the signal region are @xmath55 and @xmath56 . \n the corresponding yields in the sideband region are @xmath57 and @xmath58 . \n we correct the sideband yields with scale factors accounting for the relative area of the background in the signal and sideband intervals ( 1.047 for @xmath35 and 1.23 for @xmath33 ) . \n the scaling factors are inferred from the background component of the @xmath50 fits . \n we obtain @xmath59 tagged events , and @xmath60 tagged events . as we are interested in counting the number of signal events , and not in measuring a production rate , the errors only reflect the uncertainty in the background subtraction . note \n that the estimated background is only 1.7% of the signal for @xmath35 and 3.9% for @xmath33 .    for each event selected , we study all the charged tracks not used in the tagging mode . \n we select the ones that are well - measured , and whose helical trajectories approach the event origin within a distance of 5 mm in the projection transverse to the beam and 5 cm in the projection along the beam axis \n . each track must include at least 50% of the hits expected for its momentum . \n moreover , it must be within the rich fiducial volume ( @xmath61 ) , where @xmath62 is the angle with respect to the beams . \n finally , we require the charged track momentum @xmath63 to be greater than or equal to 0.2 gev , as the particle species separation becomes increasingly difficult at low momenta . \n candidate positrons ( and electrons ) are selected on the basis of a likelihood ratio constructed from three inputs : the ratio between the energy deposited in the calorimeter and the momentum measured in the tracking system , the specific ionization @xmath30 measured in the drift chamber , and rich information @xcite . \n our particle identification selection criteria have an average efficiency of 0.95 in the momentum region 0.3 - 1.0 gev , and 0.71 in the region 0.2 - 0.3 gev . \n the @xmath20 sample contains a small fraction of hadrons that pass our selection criteria . as the probability that a @xmath64 is identified as an @xmath27 at a given momentum is different from the corresponding @xmath34 to @xmath27 misidentification probability , we need to know the @xmath34 and @xmath64 yields separately to subtract this background . \n we select @xmath64 and @xmath34 samples using a particle identification variable ( pid ) that combines rich and @xmath30 information , if the rich identification variable @xcite is available and @xmath65 ; alternatively pid relies on @xmath30 only . \n the @xmath64 sample contains also a @xmath66 component , as our pid variable is not very selective ; however , as our goal is only to unfold the true @xmath27 spectrum , we do not need to correct for this effect . \n we separate @xmath27 , @xmath64 , and @xmath34 into `` right - sign '' and `` wrong - sign '' samples according to their charge correlation to the flavor tag . \n right - sign assignment is based on the expected @xmath27 charge on the basis of the flavor of the decaying @xmath6 . \n the true @xmath27 populations in the right - sign and wrong - sign samples are obtained through an unfolding procedure , using the matrix : @xmath67 here @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 represent the raw measured spectra in the corresponding particle species , and the coefficient @xmath71 accounts for the fact that the efficiencies for @xmath64 and @xmath66 selection are not necessarily identical , especially at low momenta . \n the quantities @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 represent the true @xmath27 , @xmath64 and @xmath34 spectra : the present paper focuses on the extraction of @xmath72 . as the @xmath64 to @xmath27 misidentification probability is quite small , the effect of a small @xmath66 component in the measured @xmath64 population @xmath69 is negligible . \n the efficiencies @xmath75 account for track finding , track selection criteria , and particle identification losses . \n the tracking efficiencies are obtained from a monte carlo simulation of @xmath22 events in the cleo - c detector . \n the generator incorporates all the known @xmath6 decay properties , includes initial state radiation ( isr ) , and final state radiation ( fsr ) effects , the latter are modeled with the program photos @xcite . \n the particle identification efficiencies are determined from data . \n we study the @xmath34 selection efficiencies using a sample of @xmath76 decays , and @xmath64 selection efficiencies using @xmath77 and @xmath78 decays . \n the @xmath20 identification efficiency is extracted from a radiative bhabha sample . a correction for the difference between the @xmath22 event environment and the simpler radiative bhabha environment ( \n two charged tracks and one shower ) is derived using a monte carlo sample where a real electron track stripped from a radiative bhabha event is merged with tracks from a simulated hadronic environment . \n the off - diagonal elements are products of tracking efficiencies and particle misidentification probabilities , where @xmath79 is defined as the probability that particle @xmath16 is identified as particle @xmath80 . \n the @xmath79 parameters are determined using @xmath27 samples from radiative bhabhas , and @xmath34 and @xmath64 from @xmath81 and @xmath78 . the @xmath27 spectrum from radiative bhabhas \n is divided in 50 mev momentum bins to determine the corresponding misidentification probabilities , whereas the @xmath34 and @xmath64 populations are subdivided into 100 mev momentum bins to reduce the statistical uncertainty . \n the hadron to @xmath20 misidentification probabilities are of the order of 0.1% over most of the momentum range and below 1% even in the regions where @xmath30 separation is less effective . \n there are background sources that are charge symmetric , mostly produced by @xmath82 dalitz decays and @xmath83 conversions . \n we subtract the wrong sign unfolded yields from the corresponding right sign yields to account for them , motivated by monte carlo studies that confirm the accuracy of this method .    in order to subtract the combinatoric background , we repeat the unfolding procedure determining the true @xmath20 yields from measured @xmath20 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 samples where the tags are selected from @xmath39 sidebands . \n the decays @xmath86 and @xmath87 have very little background : the @xmath35 sidebands give a combinatoric background estimate that is 0.2% of the signal yield and the @xmath33 sidebands give a combinatoric background estimate that is 1.8% of the signal yield . \n table [ tab : cleantags ] shows the results of the intermediate steps involved in the determination of the net @xmath20 yields . \n efficiency corrections increase unfolded @xmath20 yields with respect to uncorrected @xmath20 yields , while the subtraction of the contribution from misidentified hadrons reduces them . \n the former effect is dominant for the right - sign positron sample , while it is comparable in size to the background subtraction in the wrong - sign sample . \n the final yields , identified as `` corrected net @xmath20 '' include acceptance corrections related to the ( @xmath88 ) cut , and doubly - cabibbo suppressed ( dcsd ) effects in @xmath9 decays . \n as we are using the charge of the tagging @xmath33 , rather than its @xmath34 daughter charge , this correction is not needed in the charged mode . \n 0.5 cm    .[tab : cleantags ] positron unfolding procedure and corrections . \n the errors reported in the intermediate yields reflect only statistical uncertainties . [ \n cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we can compare these widths with the sum of the semileptonic decay widths for the pseudoscalar and vector hadronic final states recently published by cleo @xcite : @xmath89% and @xmath90% : the measured exclusive modes are consistent with saturating the inclusive widths , although there is some room left for higher multiplicity modes . \n the composition of the inclusive hadronic spectra is dominated by the low lying resonances in the @xmath91 and @xmath92 , in striking contrast with @xmath14 semileptonic decays , where a sizeable component of the inclusive branching fraction is still unaccounted for @xcite .    in conclusion \n , we report improved measurements of the absolute branching fractions for the inclusive semileptonic decays @xmath93 and @xmath94 . using the measured @xmath6 meson lifetimes , \n the ratio @xmath95 is extracted , and it is consistent with isospin invariance . \n the shapes of the spectra are consistent with one another within error .",

    "transporting charged particles between different traps has become an important feature in high - precision spectroscopy experiments of different types . in many experiments in atomic and molecular physics , the optical probing of the ions is not carried out at the same location as the creation or state preparation . in our double linear radio - frequency trap , \n we have implemented a fast protocol allowing to shuttle large ion clouds very efficiently between traps , in times shorter than a millisecond . moreover , our shuttling protocol is a one - way process , allowing to add ions to an existing cloud without loss of the already trapped sample . \n this feature makes accumulation possible , resulting in the creation of large ion clouds . \n experimental results show , that ion clouds of large size are reached with laser - cooling , however , the described mechanism does not rely on any cooling process . \n due to their extremely long storage times and their versatility , radio - frequency ( rf ) traps are a popular tool for many high - resolution experiments , from quantum information to cold chemistry . \n they allow the manipulation and interrogation of ion ensembles from a few units to a million particles , with the possibility to optimise trapping geometries and cloud sizes . \n transporting ions has always been an important ingredient in chemistry or mass spectrometry , where ions are created in external sources , and have to be brought to and accumulated in a trap @xcite . \n this issue is even more important if the production rate of the ions is low , for example in the case of rare or exotic ions . in this case , the accumulation of ions in the trap is another key - element for the optimisation of the signal - to - noise ratio . \n the transfer of ions is central in microwave frequency - metrology experiments , in order to use two separated trapping zones for state - preparation and probing of the ions @xcite . \n shuttling also gains in importance in quantum information where scalable architectures require the possibility to move ions from on site to another @xcite . \n a major issue during transport is the heating of the transferred atoms or molecules , and as a consequence the large majority of applied protocols uses a cooling mechanism and or a tailored protocol to limit heating and therefore reduce perturbation and loss of the sample . \n we have recently applied a generic transport protocol , which we have adapted from single - ion translation to the shuttling of a large ion cloud in a macroscopic set - up , and we could demonstrate transfer efficiencies up to 100% @xcite . \n the single - ion transport in micro - traps for quantum information processing has a particular experimental frame : transport distances are very short ( a few 100 @xmath0 m ) , and the objective is to keep the ion(s ) in the vibrational ground state . by using many compensation electrodes \n @xcite , the transport is designed as a translation of the harmonic potential well ( see for example @xcite ) . \n our experimental set - up is different : we aim to shuttle clouds comprising a few thousand ions over a distance of 23  mm , by using a total of three dc - electrodes . despite the differences in size and design \n , we could adapt protocols tailored for single ions to the macroscopic set - up @xcite . for ion clouds we observed an extra effect which plays the role of a one - way valve allowing ions to be shuttled from a first trap to a second trap , while forbidding the return of ions already in the second trap . in the present letter \n , we demonstrate how this `` asymmetry '' in the working conditions can be exploited to accumulate ions in an ion trap in order to create very large ion clouds . \n the described process can be optimised by choosing an appropriate set of parameters for the transport between two traps . \n the physical process involved does not require any cooling mechanism during or after the shuttling process to assure no loss from the ions already accumulated in the trap . \n it can then be used to build mixed species cloud , and finds interest in applications in physical chemistry , frequency metrology and antimatter trapping .",

    "the possible existence of topological insulators in cubic pyrochlore iridates a@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 ( a = y or rare - earth elements ) is investigated by taking into account the strong spin - orbit coupling and trigonal crystal field effect . \n it is found that the trigonal crystal field effect , which is always present in real systems , may destabilize the topological insulator proposed for the ideal cubic crystal field , leading to a metallic ground state . \n thus the trigonal crystal field is an important control parameter for the metal - insulator changeover . \n we propose that this could be one of the reasons why distinct low temperature ground states may arise for the pyrochlore iridates with different a - site ions . on the other hand , \n examining the electron - lattice coupling , we find that softening of the @xmath2=0 modes corresponding to trigonal or tetragonal distortions of the ir pyrochlore lattice leads to the resurrection of the strong topological insulator . \n thus , in principle , a finite temperature transition to a low - temperature topological insulator can occur via structural changes . \n we also suggest that the application of the external pressure along [ 111 ] or its equivalent directions would be the most efficient way of generating strong topological insulators in pyrochlore iridates .",
    "genetic oscillators play important roles in cell life regulation . \n the regulatory efficiency usually depends strongly on the emergence of stable collective dynamic modes , which requires designing the interactions between genetic networks . \n we investigate the dynamics of two identical synthetic genetic repressilators coupled by an additional plasmid which implements quorum sensing ( qs ) in each network thereby supporting global coupling . in a basic genetic ring oscillator network \n in which three genes inhibit each other in unidirectional manner , qs stimulates the transcriptional activity of chosen genes providing for competition between inhibitory and stimulatory activities localized in those genes . \n the `` promoter strength '' , the hill cooperativity coefficient of transcription repression , and the coupling strength , i.e. , parameters controlling the basic rates of genetic reactions , were chosen for extensive bifurcation analysis . \n the results are presented as a map of dynamic regimes . \n we found that the remarkable multistability of the anti - phase limit cycle and stable homogeneous and inhomogeneous steady states exists over broad ranges of control parameters . \n we studied the anti - phase limit cycle stability and the evolution of irregular oscillatory regimes in the parameter areas where the anti - phase cycle loses stability . in these regions we observed developing complex oscillations , collective chaos , and multistability between regular limit cycles and complex oscillations over uncommonly large intervals of coupling strength . \n qs - coupling stimulates the appearance of intrachaotic periodic windows with spatially symmetric and asymmetric partial limit cycles which , in turn , change the type of chaos from a simple anti - phase character into chaos composed of pieces of the trajectories having alternating polarity . \n the very rich dynamics discovered in the system of two identical simple ring oscillators may serve as a possible background for biological phenotypic diversification , as well as a stimulator to search for similar coupling in oscillator arrays in other areas of nature , e.g. in neurobiology , ecology , climatology etc .",

    "we use raman - assisted tunneling in an optical superlattice to generate large tunable effective magnetic fields for ultracold atoms . \n when hopping in the lattice , the accumulated phase shift by an atom is equivalent to the aharonov - bohm phase of a charged particle exposed to a staggered magnetic field of large magnitude , on the order of one flux quantum per plaquette . \n we study the ground state of this system and observe that the frustration induced by the magnetic field can lead to a degenerate ground state for non - interacting particles . \n we provide a measurement of the local phase acquired from raman - induced tunneling , demonstrating time - reversal symmetry breaking of the underlying hamiltonian . \n furthermore , the quantum cyclotron orbit of single atoms in the lattice exposed to the magnetic field is directly revealed . \n the application of strong magnetic fields to two - dimensional electron gases has led to the discovery of seminal quantum many - body phenomena , such as the integer and fractional quantum hall effect @xcite . \n ultracold atoms constitute a unique experimental system for studying such systems in a clean and well controlled environment and for exploring new physical regimes , not attainable in typical condensed matter systems @xcite . \n however , charge neutrality of atoms prevents direct application of the lorentz force with a magnetic field . \n an equivalent effect can be provided by the coriolis force in a rotating atomic gas , which led to the observation of quantized vortices in a bose - einstein condensate @xcite . \n the regime of fast rotation , in which the atomic gas occupies the lowest landau level , was achieved in refs .  @xcite but the amplitude of the effective gauge field remained too small to enter the strongly correlated regime that requires a number of vortices on the order of the particle number @xcite . \n an alternative route consists in applying raman lasers to the gas in order to realize a berry s phase for a moving particle @xcite . \n the effective gauge fields generated in such a setup resulted in the observation of a few vortices , but were still far from the strong - field regime .    in this letter , we demonstrate the creation of strong effective magnetic fields for ultracold atoms in a two - dimensional optical lattice . inspired by the proposal of jaksch and zoller @xcite and subsequent work @xcite , our technique is based on atom tunneling assisted by raman transitions [ see fig .  [ \n fig_scheme](a ) ] . due to the spatial variation of the raman coupling , \n the wavefunction of an atom tunneling from one lattice site to another acquires a non - trivial phase , which can be interpreted as an effective aharonov - bohm phase . in our setup , the magnetic flux per four - site plaquette is staggered with a zero mean , alternating between @xmath0 and @xmath1 [ see fig . \n [ fig_scheme](b ) ] @xcite . \n we study the nature of the ground state in this optical lattice from its momentum distribution and show in particular that the frustration associated with the effective magnetic field can lead to a degenerate ground state for single particles , similar to the prediction of ref . \n @xcite . \n we also study the quantum cyclotron dynamics of single atoms restricted to a four - site plaquette and obtain direct evidence for time - reversal symmetry breaking of the hamiltonian .    . \n while bare tunneling occurs along the @xmath2 direction with amplitude @xmath3 , it is inhibited along @xmath4 owing to a staggered potential offset @xmath5 . a pair of raman lasers with wave vectors @xmath6 and frequency difference @xmath7 , induces a resonant tunnel coupling of magnitude @xmath8 whose phase depends on position . \n this realizes an effective flux @xmath9 per plaquette with alternating sign along @xmath4 . * \n ( b ) * spatial distribution of the phase of the raman - induced tunnel coupling realized in the experiment . \n the gray shaded area highlights the magnetic unit cell.[fig_scheme ] ]     ms for * ( a ) * simple cubic lattice , * ( b ) * @xmath10 and * ( c ) * @xmath11 . \n the latter two are compared with theoretical profiles obtained by an exact diagonalization of hamiltonian ( [ eq_hamiltonian ] ) on a @xmath12 lattice with harmonic confinement @xcite . \n red squares in the theoretical profiles indicate the magnetic brillouin zone and the crosses mark the center . * \n ( d ) * projection along @xmath2 of the momentum peaks located at @xmath13 , as a function of @xmath14 . for @xmath15 \n the peaks are located at @xmath16 , while for @xmath17 the peaks are split due to the emergent ground - state degeneracy ( see insets ) . \n the solid lines correspond to the minima of the lowest bloch band for a translationally invariant system @xcite . \n [ fig_diffraction_pattern ] ]    our experimental setup consists of an ultracold gas of @xmath18rb atoms held in a two - dimensional square lattice , forming an array of 1d bose gases . \n the lattice was created by two standing waves of laser light at @xmath19 nm ( ` short ' lattices ) and a third one with twice the wavelength ( ` long ' lattice , @xmath20 ) to generate a staggered potential with amplitude @xmath5 as shown in fig . \n [ fig_scheme](a ) . \n a pair of raman lasers then induced tunneling along the staggered direction . \n let us consider the raman - assisted tunneling of an atom from a site of low energy at @xmath21 to a site of high energy at @xmath22 . \n assuming @xmath23 , one obtains @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the wave vector @xcite . \n the system is then effectively described by the non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath26 where the sign of the phase factor is positive for even sites of @xmath4 and negative otherwise . \n the phase factors in @xmath27 can be interpreted as aharonov - bohm phases . for the propagation of the raman beams shown in fig . \n [ fig_scheme](a ) along @xmath4 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we obtain a phase factor of @xmath30 . \n therefore the phase accumulated on a closed path around a plaquette is equal to @xmath31 , alternating in sign along the @xmath4 direction . a different value of the flux @xmath32 could be achieved by choosing a different wavelength for the raman lasers or by using a different angle between them , allowing for a fully tunable flux per plaquette in our setup .    our experiment started by loading a bose - einstein condensate of about @xmath33 atoms into a staggered 2d optical lattice as shown in fig . \n [ fig_scheme](a ) with @xmath34khz , resulting in an array of tubes with no coherence along @xmath4 @xcite . \n we then switched on the raman lasers on resonance with strength @xmath35 to restore the coherence . in the limit @xmath36 , \n the amplitude of raman induced tunnel coupling is @xmath37 , with @xmath38 being the bare tunnel coupling along @xmath4 . for our experimental parameters , \n this yields a value of @xmath39hz , in agreement with an independent measurement of @xmath40hz @xcite . after holding the atoms in this configuration for @xmath41ms \n , we observed a momentum distribution with restored phase coherence as shown in fig . \n [ fig_diffraction_pattern](b ) . this can be attributed to a redistribution of entropy present in the random phases between the 1d condensates into their longitudinal modes .    to understand the momentum distribution , we calculated the bandstructure of this lattice in the tight - binding approximation according to ref . \n @xcite . in the presence of the gauge field , \n the hamiltonian remains periodic . \n however , the magnetic unit cell contains two non - equivalent sites , leading to a splitting of the tight - binding band structure into two subbands @xcite . \n the frustration introduced by the position - dependent phase factors in @xmath27 causes the phase of the atomic wavefunction to be non - uniform , leading to a condensation at non - zero momenta . in the case \n @xmath42 , we obtain a non - degenerate ground state . \n however , the wavefunction itself consists of two momentum components , therefore we observe two diffraction peaks within the first magnetic brillouin zone , one being shifted by @xmath43 with respect to the minimum of the dispersion relation @xcite . due to the unit cell containing more than one lattice site , \n the size of the magnetic brillouin zone is reduced compared to the one of the square lattice [ see fig . \n [ fig_dispersion_flux](a ) ] . \n therefore the ground - state momentum distribution exhibits several peaks in the short - lattice brillouin zone , whose measured positions are in good agreement with the quasi - momenta of the bloch states of lowest energy [ see fig . \n [ fig_diffraction_pattern](b ) ] . \n when varying the ratio @xmath14 by adjusting the @xmath2-lattice depth , we observed the positions and number of peaks in the momentum distribution to remain unchanged for @xmath44 [ see fig . \n [ fig_diffraction_pattern](d ) ] . above this value , \n additional peaks appear [ see fig . \n [ fig_diffraction_pattern](c ) ] , which correspond to the population of two degenerate ground states . \n this behavior agrees with the bandstructure calculation , which shows a bifurcation at @xmath45 , above which the energy minimum is split into two degenerate ground states [ see fig .  [ \n fig_dispersion_flux](b ) ] . \n we find the measured and predicted peak positions of these two ground states to be in good agreement [ see fig .  [ fig_diffraction_pattern](d ) ] . \n the nature of the bifurcation is identical to the one predicted in ref . \n @xcite where it is induced by a variation of the magnetic flux amplitude at a fixed value of @xmath46 . as shown in fig . \n [ fig_dispersion_flux](d ) , the atomic density is uniform for @xmath46 , while in the case @xmath47 it is strongly modulated for both single - particle ground states [ see fig . \n [ fig_dispersion_flux](e ) ] . for @xmath48 \n the bare coupling dominates and the phases of the atomic wavefunction tend to align along the @xmath2 direction , thereby frustrating the phase relation imposed by the hamiltonian . as a consequence , \n the density in every second stripe along @xmath2 is suppressed . \n contrary to the case of a triangular lattice with frustrated hopping studied in @xcite , the atom fraction in each single - particle ground state does not fluctuate , as shown in fig . \n [ fig_dispersion_flux](c ) , and we observe an equal population in both states as predicted for interacting @xcite or finite size systems @xcite .    in order to directly reveal time - reversal symmetry breaking of the hamiltonian , we probed the local structure of the lattice with artificial gauge field at the level of a four - site square plaquette , which allows us to isolate plaquettes with equal sign of the flux . \n this was achieved by applying superlattice potentials along both the @xmath4- and @xmath2-directions , and in order to avoid coupling to axial modes along the potential tubes , an additional lattice along the @xmath49-direction ( @xmath50 nm ) was used in these measurements . \n the four sites of a single plaquette are denoted as @xmath51 [ see inset fig .  [ fig_local_phase_measurement](a ) ] . \n the relative phases of the long and short lattices were adjusted so that the plaquettes were symmetric along @xmath2 and tilted along @xmath4 , with an energy offset @xmath52khz . \n we first loaded single atoms in the ground state of the tilted plaquettes @xmath53 , and subsequently switched on the raman lasers with @xmath54 in order to induce resonant coupling to the @xmath55 and @xmath56 sites . \n in the limit @xmath57 , the dynamics along @xmath2 would be suppressed and the initial state @xmath58 couples to the state @xmath59 , where the relative phase is induced by the raman lasers . in our case ( @xmath60 ) \n the evolution of the imprinted phase factors is more complex . \n we measured this evolution through the shape of the momentum distribution obtained after time - of - flight @xcite . \n this dynamics is a direct consequence of the complex phase factor , revealing the time - reversal symmetry breaking of the hamiltonian [ see fig .  [ fig_local_phase_measurement](a ) ] . \n for @xmath61 the role of the raman beams is exchanged leading to a sign reversal of the phase evolution . \n we also investigated this dynamics in real space in order to exhibit the influence of the gauge field on the particle flow . by generalizing the site - resolved measurement technique performed in @xcite for an array of double - wells to plaquettes , we measured the atom population per site @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) @xcite , thus obtaining the average atom positions @xmath64 and @xmath65 , with @xmath66 being the total atom number . in the initial state @xmath67 the atoms occupy the left wells @xmath68 and @xmath69 with equal weights . \n after switching on the raman lasers we observe a coherent particle flow inside the plaquettes . \n besides the particle current towards the right wells @xmath55 and @xmath56 [ see fig . \n [ fig_local_phase_measurement](c ) ] , we observe a deviation of the mean atom position along @xmath2 [ see fig . \n [ fig_local_phase_measurement](d ) ] . \n this behavior is reminiscent of the lorentz force acting on a charged particle in a magnetic field . as shown in fig . \n [ fig_local_phase_measurement](b ) , the mean atom position follows an orbit that is a small - scale quantum analog of the classical cyclotron orbits for charged particles . \n this coherent evolution is damped due to spatial inhomogeneities in the atomic sample . \n having independently calibrated the values of @xmath3 and @xmath8 , we fit from the measured atom dynamics the value of the magnetic flux @xmath70 . \n the difference from the value @xmath31 expected for a homogeneous lattice stems from the smaller distance between lattice sites inside the plaquettes when separated . for the parameters used in fig . \n [ fig_local_phase_measurement](b)-(d ) we calculate a distance @xmath71 yielding @xmath72 , which qualitatively explains the measured flux value . \n residual deviations might be due to an angle mismatch between the raman beams and the lattices beams . \n ( integrated along @xmath4 ) , as a function of time for @xmath54 ( blue ) and @xmath73 ( gray ) . \n the inset shows the fourier transformation for @xmath54 depicting two frequency components at @xmath74khz and @xmath75khz , in good agreement with theory ( vertical lines ) . * \n ( b ) * cyclotron orbits of the average particle position obtained from the mean atom positions @xmath76 * ( c ) * and @xmath77 * ( d ) * for @xmath78khz , @xmath79khz and @xmath80khz . \n each data point is an average over three measurements . \n the inset in * ( b ) * shows the theoretical curve calculated for @xmath81 and a @xmath82damping time of @xmath83ms obtained from damped sine fits to @xmath76 and @xmath77 . \n [ fig_local_phase_measurement ] ]    in conclusion , we have demonstrated a new type of optical lattice that realizes strong effective magnetic fields and breaks time - reversal symmetry . \n we have shown that the atomic sample relaxes to the minima of the magnetic bandstructure , realizing an analogue of a frustrated classical spin system . however , the spatial average of the magnetic flux is zero , hence the bloch band is topologically trivial @xcite . by using a superlattice potential with more than two non - equivalent sites @xcite or a linear tilt potential @xcite , it is possible to create a lattice with a uniform and non - zero magnetic flux . \n this system would realize the harper hamiltonian @xcite and lead to the fractal band structure of the hofstadter butterfly @xcite . \n in particular the lowest band would exhibit a chern number of one and be analogous to the lowest landau level @xcite . \n our work constitutes an important step towards the study of quantum hall effect with ultracold atomic gases and the creation of strongly - interacting liquids such as the laughlin state @xcite . \n we acknowledge insightful discussions with n. cooper . \n this work was supported by the dfg ( for635 , for801 ) , the eu ( strep , namequam , marie curie fellowship to s.n . ) , and darpa ( ole program ) . \n 10 [ 1]`#1 ` [ 2][]#2    d.  tsui , h.  stormer and a.  gossard , phys . \n rev . \n lett . \n * 48 * , 1559 ( 1982 ) ;

field method and linear operator theory . \n the mechanism of bifurcation for the incoherent state near the critical point is further revealed by the amplitude expansion theory , which shows that the oscillating standing wave state could also occur in this model for certain frequency distributions . \n our theoretical analysis and numerical results are consistent with each other , which can help us understand the synchronization transition in general networks with heterogenous couplings . \n *    synchronization in dynamical systems of coupled oscillators is one important issue in the frontier of nonlinear dynamics and complex systems . \n this study provides insights for understanding the collective behaviors in many fields , such as the power grids , the flashing of fireflies , the rhythm of pacemaker cells of the heart , and even some social phenomena  @xcite . \n theoretically , the classical kuramoto model with its generalizations turn out to be paradigms for synchronization problem , which have inspired a wealth of works because of both their simplicity for mathematical treatment and their relevance to practice @xcite .    recently , the first - order synchronization transition in networked kuramoto - like oscillators has attracted much attention . \n for instance , it has been shown that the positive correlation of frequency - degree in the scale - free network , or a particular realization of frequency distribution of oscillators in an all - to - all network , or certain special couplings among oscillators , etc , would cause a discontinuous phase transition to synchronization @xcite . \n in particular , our recent work  @xcite analytically investigated the mechanism of the first - order phase transition on star network . \n we revealed that the structural relationship between the incoherent state and the synchronous state leads to different routes to the transition of synchronization . \n furthermore , it has been shown that the generalized kuramoto model with frequency - weighted coupling can generate first - order synchronization transition in general networks @xcite . in ref . \n @xcite , the critical coupling strength for both forward and backward transitions , as well as the stability of the two - cluster coherent state , have been further determined analytically for typical frequency distributions .    in this paper , we present a complete framework to investigate the synchronization in the frequency - weighted kuramoto model with all - to - all couplings . \n it includes three separate analyses from different angles , which together presents a global picture for our understanding of the synchronization in the model . \n first , a rigorous mean - field analysis is implemented where the possible steady states of the model are predicted , such as the incoherent state , the two - cluster synchronous state , and the traveling wave state . \n it is shown that in this model the mean - field frequency is not necessarily equal to 0 . \n instead , the non - vanishing mean - field frequency plays a crucial role in determining the critical coupling strength . \n second , a detailed linear stability analysis of the incoherent state is performed . \n also , the exact expression for the critical coupling strength is obtained , which is consistent with the results of the mean - field analysis , and keeps the same form for general heterogenous couplings @xcite . \n furthermore , it has been proved that the linearized operator has no discrete spectrum when the coupling strength is below a threshold . \n this implies that in this model the incoherent state is only neutrally stable below the synchronization threshold . \n interestingly , numerical simulations demonstrate that in this neutrally stable regime predicted by the linear theory , the perturbed order parameter decays to zero and its decaying envelope follows exponential form for short time . \n finally , a nonlinear center - manifold reduction to the model is conducted , which reveals the local bifurcation mechanism of the incoherent state near the critical point . as expected \n , the non - stationary standing wave state could also exist in this model with certain frequency distributions . \n extensive numerical simulations have been carried out to verify our theoretical analyses . in the following , \n we report our main results , both theoretically and numerically .    * results * + * the mean -

field corresponding to the peak of the distribution of phases . \n when @xmath1 is small enough , @xmath12 characterizing the incoherent state in which the phases of oscillators are almost randomly distributed . as @xmath1 increases , usually a cluster of phase - locked oscillators \n appear , characterized by an order parameter @xmath13 . \n then the system is in the synchronous ( coherent ) state where the phase - locked oscillators coexist with the phase - drifting ones . \n one central issue in the study of synchronization is to identify all the possible asymptotic coherent states of the system as the coupling strength @xmath1 increases . to this end \n , the self - consistence method turns out to be effective . in the following , we conduct theoretical analysis to eq . \n ( [ equ : re1 ] ) based on this method .    substituting eq . \n ( [ equ : re2 ] ) into eq . \n ( [ equ : re1 ] ) , we obtain the dynamical equation of the mean -

( [ equ : re33 ] ) shows that the drifting oscillators have no contributions to the real part of @xmath10 . \n however , their contributions to the imaginary part of @xmath10 should not be neglected . \n substituting eq . \n ( [ equ : re30])- eq . \n ( [ equ : re34 ] ) into eq . \n ( [ equ : re29 ] ) , the closed form of self - consistence equations take the following form . for the real part of @xmath10 , @xmath45 and for the imaginary part of it @xmath46 eq . \n ( [ equ : re36 ] ) is called as the phase balance equation  @xcite . \n eq . \n ( [ equ : re35 ] ) and eq . \n ( [ equ : re36 ] ) together provide a closed equation for the dependence of the magnitude @xmath10 and the frequency @xmath15 of the mean field on @xmath1 . \n we notice that @xmath20 is always a trivial solution of eq . \n ( [ equ : re36 ] ) , but it may not be the only solution \n . there may be more than one value for @xmath15 that satisfies the phase balance equation . \n considering @xmath47 , a pair of @xmath15 with opposite sign might emerge . \n define @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , eq . \n ( [ equ : re35 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath51 for the case of @xmath52 , to avoid divergency of eq . \n ( [ equ : re37 ] ) , the only choice is @xmath20 , and eq . \n ( [ equ : re35 ] ) is reduced as @xmath53 which exactly corresponds to the two - cluster synchronous state in ref . \n @xcite . \n for the case of @xmath54 , the solution of eq . \n ( [ equ : re36])- eq .  ( [ equ : re37 ] ) can be solved numerically , which corresponds to the traveling wave state . \n in such a state , the mean - field amplitude @xmath10 keeps stationary , whereas the mean - field frequency @xmath15 differs from the mean of the natural frequencies . in particular , in the limit case @xmath55 , the critical coupling @xmath7 for the onset of synchronization reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the critical mean - field frequency . \n thus , following the analysis of eq . \n ( [ equ : re39 ] ) , we can conclude that @xmath58 means @xmath59 , which is not supported by numerical simulation . by taylor expansion of eq . \n ( [ equ : re36 ] ) , we find that @xmath57 satisfies the following balance equation @xmath60 where the symbol @xmath61 means the principal - value integration within the real line . as an example , table \n [ table:1 ] shows the balance equation  ( [ equ : re40 ] ) , the critical mean - field frequency @xmath57 , and the critical coupling strength @xmath7 with respect to different frequency distributions . \n all these analytical results were supported by the previous numerical simulations  @xcite .    * the linear stability analysis . * \n the analysis of the mean - field theory above reveals four macroscopic steady states , including the incoherent state ( @xmath62 ) , the traveling wave state ( @xmath50 , @xmath63 ) , and the two - cluster synchronous states ( @xmath20 , @xmath52 ) , respectively . \n however , a thorough stability analysis to every possible solution has not been performed due to the limitation of the mean - field method . in the following , \n we conduct a detailed linear stability analysis to the incoherent state because its instability usually signals the onset of synchronization . \n in particular , we will show that the critical coupling strength for synchronization can be alternatively obtained via the linear operator theory . \n the continuum limit of the order parameter , i.e. , eq . \n ( [ equ : re2 ] ) , is rewritten as @xmath64 and the velocity is given by @xmath65 where \n @xmath66 \" denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath67 . \n let @xmath68 be the @xmath69th fourier coefficient of @xmath70 , then @xmath71 and @xmath72 satisfies the following differential equations @xmath73 from eq . \n ( [ equ : re5 ] ) , it is easy to verify that the order parameter @xmath67 is the integral of @xmath74 with the frequency density function @xmath5 , and the higher fourier harmonics have no contribution to the order parameter . since the incoherent state corresponds to the trivial solution @xmath75 for @xmath76 , to study its stability we can consider the evolution of a perturbation away from the incoherent state . in this spirit , eq . \n ( [ equ : re8 ] ) can be linearized around the origin as @xmath77 and @xmath78 here @xmath79 is the operator defined as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a function in the weighted lebesgue space , and @xmath82 is defined as @xmath83 from eq . \n ( [ equ : re10 ] ) , it is obvious that the higher fourier harmonics are neutrally stable to perturbation . \n hence , the key is to study the spectrum of eq . \n ( [ equ : re9 ] ) . following ref . \n @xcite , eq .  ( [ equ : re9 ] ) has continuous spectrum on the whole imaginary axis . for the discrete spectrum , we assume that the perturbation of the first fourier coefficient has the form @xmath84 \n . then the self - consistent eigenvalue equation eq . \n ( [ equ : re9 ] ) for the operator @xmath82 takes the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the complex eigenvalue of @xmath82 except for those points @xmath87 . notice that eq . \n ( [ equ : re13 ] ) relates implicitly the coupling strength @xmath1 with the eigenvalue @xmath86 . since the real part of the eigenvalue @xmath86 determines the stability of the incoherent state , we rewrite eq . \n ( [ equ : re13 ] ) into two equations by letting @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 and @xmath90 from eq . \n ( [ equ : re14 ] ) , we see that @xmath91 , i.e. , the real part of @xmath86 , can never be negative , otherwise @xmath92 , which makes no physical sense . \n hence , the incoherent state in model ( [ equ : re1 ] ) can not be linearly stable . \n in fact , it is neutrally stable due to the existence of continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis @xcite . furthermore , if the coupling strength @xmath93 but sufficiently small , we have proved that the eigenvalue @xmath86 does not exist ( the details are included in the supplementary material ) . \n the analysis above reveals that the linearized operator @xmath82 has continuous spectrum @xmath87 lying on the whole imaginary axis ( with real part equals to @xmath6 ) for all @xmath1 , and it may also have discrete spectrum ( eigenvalues ) depending on @xmath1 . \n when @xmath1 is small ( @xmath94 ) the discrete spectrum is empty , but as @xmath1 increases , discrete eigenvalues emerge with real part @xmath95 for @xmath96 . imposing the critical condition @xmath97 for eq  ( [ equ : re14 ] ) , once again we obtain the critical coupling strength as @xmath98 where @xmath99 are determined by the eq . \n ( [ equ : re15 ] ) with the limit @xmath97 . evidently , @xmath57 is the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of operator @xmath82 at the boundary of stability . \n generally eq . \n ( [ equ : re15 ] ) may have more than one root with @xmath97 . \n @xmath100 means that we choose the @xmath101th root @xmath99 which makes the product @xmath102 is maximal , so that @xmath103 corresponds to the foremost critical point for the onset of synchronization . \n according to the above linear stability analysis , the incoherent state of model ( [ equ : re1 ] ) is only neutrally stable below the synchronization threshold . \n however , interestingly , we find that in this regime the perturbed order parameter @xmath67 actually decays to zero in the long time limit ( @xmath104 ) . \n this phenomenon was first found in the classical kuramoto model , and was revealed to be analogous to the famous landau damping in plasma physics @xcite . to investigate the landau damping effect in our model , we rewrite eq . \n ( [ equ : re9 ] ) as @xmath105 which could be solved explicitly , i.e. , @xmath106 substituting eq . \n ( [ equ : re23 ] ) into the expression of @xmath67 , we obtain the perturbed order parameter as @xmath107 here @xmath108 is a constant related to the initial value and it is convenient to set @xmath109 . \n eq . \n ( [ equ : re24 ] ) represents a closed form for the dependence of @xmath110 on the coupling strength @xmath1 . \n unfortunately , it is difficult to get the expression of @xmath110 analytically for the present model . \n however , we still can obtain useful information via direct numerical simulations . in fig . \n [ fig:1 ] , the numerical solutions of eq . \n ( [ equ : re24 ] ) are illustrated for different values of @xmath1 and typical frequency distributions @xmath5 . \n generally , we observe the decay of @xmath111 , i.e , @xmath112 . depending on @xmath5 and @xmath1 , \n the scenarios turn out to be different . \n we notice that when the coupling constant is absent , eq . \n ( [ equ : re24 ] ) can be solved analytically . \n specifically , for example , when @xmath113 , @xmath114 for the uniform distribution [ fig . \n [ fig:1](a ) ] , @xmath115 for the triangle distribution [ fig . \n [ fig:1](d ) ] , and @xmath116 for the lorentzian distribution [ fig . \n [ fig:1](g ) ] . in these cases , \n the decay phenomena strongly depend on the form of @xmath5 . \n however , with the increasing of @xmath1 the situation changes . it is observed that the order parameter decays in a way with significant oscillation . \n nevertheless , its envelope follows the form of exponential decay , namely , @xmath117 for a short time , where @xmath118 is the decay exponent . while the general dynamical mechanism of this decay is still an open issue , ref . \n @xcite pointed out that this exponential decay of order parameter in the neutrally stable regime is closely related to the resonance pole on the left - half complex plane , and the decaying rate @xmath118 is the real part of it . \n for the two - cluster synchronous states eq . \n ( [ equ : re38 ] ) , previous analysis has shown that @xmath119 is linearly stable , and @xmath120 is linearly unstable  @xcite . for the traveling wave state in the range ( @xmath63 ) , its stability \n can only be studied through numerical simulations . \n we have conducted extensive simulations by choosing different initial conditions for phase oscillators . \n we even specially choose a proper initial condition to make the system artificially locate onto the traveling wave state . \n it is found that in all these cases the system evolves to the two - cluster synchronous state as long as @xmath121 ( the subscript @xmath122 denotes the backward transition point ) . \n thus the numerical results give evidence that the traveling wave state predicted by the mean - field theory turns out to be unstable in the current model .    * the bifurcation analysis . * \n the above stability analysis leads to the conclusion that near the finite critical coupling @xmath7 , the incoherent state becomes unstable with the emergence of a pair of complex conjugated eigenvalues @xmath123 ; meanwhile the traveling wave solution is unstable . \n moreover , due to the absolute coupling , eq  ( [ equ : re1 ] ) always has the two - cluster synchronous solution [ eq . \n ( [ equ : re38 ] ) ] when @xmath124 . \n this is independent of the specific form of @xmath5 as long as @xmath5 is symmetric and centered at @xmath6 @xcite . \n thus , if @xmath125 , the first - order synchronization transition would take place . however , the mechanism underlying the instability of the incoherent state is still unclear , for example , the bifurcation type and the local stability of the traveling wave solution near @xmath7 . \n these information is crucial for us to get a global picture of the synchronization transition in the dynamical system . \n generally , the dynamic behavior near the critical point can be investigated through the local bifurcation theory . for this purpose \n , we refer to the framework of nonlinear analysis developed in ref . \n @xcite to reveal the local bifurcation type for the incoherent state of model ( [ equ : re1 ] ) . \n the main idea of the theory  @xcite is that when the perturbed equation of the incoherent state satisfies @xmath126 symmetry , the center manifold reduction could be applied to obtain the amplitude equations for both steady state and limit cycle . \n moreover , in order to avoid dealing with the continuous spectrum , the gaussian white noise is added and eventually the noise magnitude is extended to zero for all calculations . following this treatment , \n now the evolution of the density function @xmath127 obeys the fokker - planck equation @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the strength of noise . \n similarly , imposing the small perturbation to the incoherent state , i.e. , @xmath130 , we obtain the following perturbed equation @xmath131 here , @xmath132 is lineared equation for @xmath133 , i.e. , @xmath134,\\ ] ] and @xmath135 is the nonlinear term , i.e. , @xmath136,\\ ] ] where @xmath137 . \n then we can derive the normal form of amplitude equation for both the steady state and the hopf bifurcation in the frequency - weighted model based on the center manifold assumption . since the complete calculation is tedious , we put the details into the supplementary material for interested readers . in the following we only report the main results . \n it is found that for the frequency - weighted model , the system undergoes hopf bifurcation near the critical coupling @xmath7 . as a result , a traveling wave solution and a standing wave solution emerge above @xmath7 . \n the standard standing wave solution consists of two counter - rotating clusters of phase - locked oscillators . \n thus the order parameter @xmath67 plots a limit cycle on the complex plane . \n previously , such state has been found in the classical kuramoto model with symmetric bimodal frequency distribution @xcite . \n it should be pointed out that the mean - field theory fails to predict such state due to the fact that neither the distribution function nor @xmath111 are stationary in any rotating frame for such a state .    as an example to illustrate our results , we focus on the case of uniform distribution @xmath138 . the exact expression for critical coupling strength is @xmath139 . \n the nonlinear analysis shows that the bifurcation for the traveling wave solution is supercritical and unstable ( which is consistent with the mean - field theory ) . in addition \n , the standing wave solution is subcritical . \n this implies that a hysteresis would occur by taking the high order terms of the amplitude equation into account . \n numerical evidence suggests that above @xmath7 the incoherent state loses its stability . \n meanwhile , non - stationary @xmath111 emerges with a hysteresis near @xmath7 [ branch 3 in fig . \n [ fig:2 ] ] . as the coupling strength increases , and it eventually vanishes at @xmath140 via a discontinuous transition ( with very small hysteresis loop ) to the two - cluster synchronous state . \n we have also conducted calculations for other typical frequency distributions , such as the triangle , the lorentzian , and the parabolic . \n the results show that the bifurcations for the standing wave solution are all subcritical and the traveling wave solution are all unstable locally . \n moreover , the direction of bifurcation for the traveling wave state supports the numerical solution of the mean - field equation . \n it should be pointed out that the stable branch of subcritical bifurcation for both states are not observed numerically . \n one possible reason for this is that their basins of attraction might be so small in such a high - dimensional phase space that most of the initial conditions eventually lead to the stable two - cluster synchronous state as long as @xmath124 . \n * discussion * + to summarize , we investigated the synchronization transition in the frequency - weighted kuramoto model with all - to - all couplings . \n theoretically , mean - field analysis , linear stability analysis , and bifurcation analysis have been carried out to obtain insights . together with the numerical simulations , our study presented the following main results . \n first , we predicted the possible steady states in this model , including the incoherent state , the two - cluster synchronous state , the traveling wave state , and the standing wave state . \n second , the critical coupling strength for synchronization transition has been obtained analytically . \n third , we proved that in this model the incoherent state is only neutrally stable below the synchronization threshold . \n however , in this regime , the perturbed order parameter decays exponentially to zero for short time . finally , the amplitude equations near the bifurcation point have been derived based on the center - manifold reduction , which predicted that the non - stationary standing wave state could also exist in this model . \n this work provided a complete framework to deal with the frequency - weighted kuramoto model , and the obtained results will enhance our understandings of the first -

    "many proposals for fault - tolerant quantum computation require injection of ` magic states ' to achieve a universal set of operations . \n some qubit states are above a threshold fidelity , allowing them to be converted into magic states via ` magic state distillation ' , a process based on stabilizer codes from quantum error correction . \n we define quantum weight enumerators that take into account the sign of the stabilizer operators . \n these enumerators completely describe the magic state distillation behavior when distilling @xmath0-type magic states . while it is straightforward to calculate them directly by counting exponentially many operator weights , it is also an np - hard problem to compute them in general . \n this suggests that finding a family of distillation schemes with desired threshold properties is at least as hard as finding the weight distributions of a family of classical codes .    additionally , we develop search algorithms fast enough to analyze all useful 5 qubit codes and some 7 qubit codes , finding no codes that surpass the best known threshold . \n protection of quantum states via quantum error correction codes is crucial for achieving experimental quantum computation @xcite . \n however , implementing a full set of universal gates can be challenging inside an error correction code @xcite . in 2004 , \n bravyi and kitaev showed that clifford operations , a non - universal gate set , can be extended to universality via injection of certain ` magic states ' . \n furthermore , they showed that magic states could be distilled from several copies of lower - fidelity mixed resource states @xcite . \n this is known as quantum computing via state injection ( qcsi ) . \n more than a decade later , we still do not have a complete classification of mixed single - qubit states in terms of usefulness in qcsi , or a definitive method to distill an arbitrary useful state .    a discrete wigner function defined on prime - dimensional qudit states \n is a helpful tool for this classification . in the case of odd primes negativity of the wigner function \n is a necessary condition for usefulness of qcsi resource states @xcite . in the case of qubits \n the situation is more complicated , and is a subject of active study . \n wigner function negativity is no longer necessary for qubit resource states @xcite , and must be replaced with a classification in terms of non - contextual hidden variable theories @xcite . for odd - dimensional qudits \n these two notions coincide @xcite , so classification is easier . \n resource states are distilled into magic states using stabilizer codes @xcite . \n several copies of the resource state @xmath1 are projected onto the code space of a stabilizer code , and an output state @xmath2 is decoded . \n codes vary in terms of the rate at which they improve the fidelity of resource states , and often several iterations are necessary to obtain a high - fidelity magic state . \n codes can also worsen the fidelity of resource states , and have a threshold input fidelity that is required for fidelity improvement . \n classification of resource states can be achieved by finding stabilizer codes with low - enough threshold fidelity @xcite , because they give an explicit scheme for constructing magic states from low - fidelity resource states . \n our current picture of qubit resource states stems primarily from such explicit code constructions found in 2004 and 2006 . \n current works are attempting to classify qubit states using non - contextual hidden variable theories , which worked very well for odd prime dimensions @xcite . \n but even if a classification theory is available , it does not give an obvious method for code construction and searching over codes and states may still be needed @xcite . in the end \n , an explicit distillation scheme will be necessary for use in experiment . \n furthermore , we can not rule out the existence of resource states that according to hidden variable theories should be useful , but for some reason still can not be distilled by clifford operations . such resource states , if they exist , would be exciting because they might give a model of computation slightly weaker than bqp . \n thus , understanding the distillation thresholds of stabilizer codes remains pivotal for qcsi research . \n the study presented in this paper is restricted to qubit systems , and codes with a single - qubit code space . after reviewing preliminaries in section  i , \n section  ii derives the main result : _ the distillation behavior of a stabilizer code is fully characterized by a signed version of its weight enumerators_. in section  iii we briefly compare these to previous studies of quantum weight enumerators @xcite from the late 1990s , and show that computing them in general is np - hard . in section  iv we show how to extract interesting distillation properties from the weight enumerators , and define a ` distillation polynomial ' summarizing this information . in section \n v we analyze a class of codes with a particular transversal gate .",
    "this paper introduces an exact algorithm for the construction of a shortest curvature - constrained network interconnecting a given set of directed points in the plane and an iterative method for doing so in 3d space . \n such a network will be referred to as a minimum dubins network , since its edges are dubins paths ( or slight variants thereof ) . \n the problem of constructing a minimum dubins network appears in the context of underground mining optimisation , where the aim is to construct a least - cost network of tunnels navigable by trucks with a minimum turning radius . \n the dubins network problem is similar to the steiner tree problem , except that the terminals are directed and there is a curvature constraint . \n we propose the minimum curvature - constrained steiner point algorithm for determining the optimal location of the steiner point in a 3-terminal network . \n we show that when two terminals are fixed and the third varied , the steiner point traces out a limaon .",

[ [ model ] ] model + + + + +    our system consists of a multi - terminal junction made up of an even number of one - dimensional topological superconductors ( branches ) , depicted in fig . \n [ fig : system](a ) . \n they all have a common end point at the center . \n such experimentally available segments are made of semiconductor wires with spin orbit coupling proximatized by s - wave superconductors @xcite . \n alternatively , they are made of magnetic impurity chains embedded in superconductors @xcite \n .     constitute the low energy excitations of the system . a left detector ( not shown ) measures the operators indicated by solid ( green ) arrows , which are labeled by the corresponding spin algebra operators , e.g. @xmath0 playing the role of @xmath1 . dashed ( orange ) arrows define the operators measured by the right detector . \n panels ( a - d ) show different possible partitionings into left and right sectors with the corresponding operators . \n chsh inequalities are necessarily violated in at least one of the partitionings in ( a - d ) . \n [ fig : system ] ]    each segment , @xmath2 , of this setup consists of a 1-d spinless p - wave superconductor characterized by a bulk excitation energy gap , @xmath3 , and by zero - energy mbs at the end points , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , localized at the wire s boundaries . \n the dynamics of these mbs is underlined by the algebra @xmath6 , @xmath7 . \n the wire hamiltonian at energies well below the gap is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is exponentially small with the wire s length , @xmath10 . \n the latter is larger than the superconductor coherence length @xcite @xmath11 . \n we also assume @xmath12 , which is a valid assumption as long as the duration of the measurement protocol is not too long . at the junction , the josephson coupling between each pair of branches , @xmath13@xmath14 results in a low energy coupling between the corresponding majorana end - states . \n this is described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath15 . \n generically , the tunnel coupling at the junction pairs up the @xmath16 majorana end - states , @xmath17 , to finite energy states with energies @xmath18 . \n these states are then projected out of the degenerate ground - state space . \n this leaves us with the majorana states @xmath19 that are far from the junction ( see fig .

each of which is to be probed by a separate external detector . \n the detectors can be tuned to measure any combination of pairs of majorana products . \n physically this is a measurement of the occupancy of certain dirac fermions degrees of freedom , constructed from the majorana degrees of freedom . \n details of the measurement procedure are discussed below . \n an example to be utilized below is depicted in fig . \n [ fig : system](a ) , where the @xmath25-set consists of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and the coupled detector can measure any operator of the form @xmath30 note that the expectation values of the measured observables are bounded , @xmath31 ( the eigenvalues of the bilinear majorana products are @xmath32 ) . \n genuine quantum correlations underlying a state can be identified through the expectation values of correlated measurements . \n specifically , a state that can be described within a local hidden variable theory ( a.k.a . \n local realism ) , satisfies the chsh inequality @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 are pairs of spatially separable sets of observables . for quantum non - locally entangled states , it is instead possible to choose the operators such that @xcite @xmath38 , hence providing evidence of genuine quantum correlations . \n eq . \n is an equivalent formulation of bell s inequality @xcite , which , relying only on averaged correlation outputs , can be tested directly by averaging over repeated measurements , including weak measurements . \n entangled states that violate bell s and chsh inequalities are common in quantum mechanics . \n alternatively , one may construct product states which are non - entangled . \n the novel aspect of our work is that we show that in the degenerate space spanned by majorana end states , _ any _ state is non - locally entangled . in other words \n , one can always find ( at least ) one partitioning of the mbs into two spatially separable sets , where the chsh inequality is violated . loosely speaking , for any state in the degenerate ground - space it is possible to design non - local measurements that reveal intrinsic non - locality .    to begin with , \n we realize that establishing the chsh relations requires measurement of non - commuting observables for each of the separated - in - space parts of the system , _ \n i.e. _ the @xmath25 and @xmath26 sets . for observables bilinear in the elementary mbs ( cf . \n eq . ) \n , this requires a minimum of three majorana operators for each set . \n the minimal complexity setup appropriate for our purpose is therefore a multi - terminal junction consisting of six branches ( 6 mbs ) ( cf . \n fig . \n [ fig : system](a ) ) . \n we consider a generic state of the 4-degenerate odd parity ground - manifold . following the labeling of the majoranas in fig.[fig : \n system](a ) , such a state is parametrized as @xmath39 where @xmath40 . \n here we have introduced the fermionic degrees of freedom , @xmath41 @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and the state @xmath44 is defined by @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . throughout our analysis \n we will switch between fock space states , spin-1/2 states , and majorana notation . \n consider the partitioning depicted in fig . \n [ fig : system](a ) : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 constitute the ( @xmath25 ) set ;

[ \n fig : system](b ) , where the left detector is connected to @xmath29 , @xmath50 , @xmath49 while @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath48 are connected to the right detector . in this case we define he operators @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 . mapping the problem to that of a two spin @xmath59 , we can write the state @xmath64 in eq . \n ( [ eq : state ] ) as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , @xmath94 are the eigenstates of @xmath95 . for the given @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , the maximal violation of the chsh inequalities in the new partitioning ( maximal with respect of the choice of @xmath100 , @xmath101 , cf . \n eq . ) \n is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 signals non - local correlations . \n this is achieved unless @xmath104 . \n measurements of chsh inequalities following the partitionings depicted in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig . \n [ fig : system ] yield @xmath105 and @xmath106 \n . the condition @xmath107 can never be fulfilled , i.e. chsh correlations will be non - local in at least one of the four partitions considered in fig . \n [ fig : system ] . \n it is important at this point to make the following observation . \n the partitioning of the mbs into two sets naturally leads to the definition of operators satisfying spin-@xmath59 algebra for each set . \n different partitionings entails different sets of spin operators . \n such a construction of operators is not unique for mbs . \n it can be done for any quantum system whose state is spanned in a 4-dimensional space . consider the case of two real , physical , spin-@xmath59 degrees of freedom , associated with @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , which are geographically separated . \n one may construct the corresponding sets of operators @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , as is depicted in fig . \n [ fig : system](a ) . \n we now would like to switch to another partitioning ( e.g. , the one depicted in fig . \n [ fig : system](b ) ) , involving @xmath81 and @xmath80 respectively . trying to express the spin operators associated with this partitioning in terms of the _ real _ spin operators \n , we have @xmath111 , and @xmath112 . \n it then follows that @xmath113 and @xmath114 can not be measured by two spatially separated detectors . \n this is in stark difference with the foregoing majorana - based picture . \n the statement that any state of the system violates the chsh inequalities in at least one of the partitionings of fig . \n [ fig : system ] implies _ finite _ violation of chsh inequalities . \n this is quantified by introducing the maximal value of chsh correlations over the partitioning in fig . \n [ fig : system ] , @xmath115 . for any @xmath116 \n , @xmath117 is a positive finite quantity . \n there is therefore a minimum violation of the chsh inequality over all states . from a standard minimization procedure over the parameters @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 @xcite \n , we obtain @xmath118 note that , since we restrict the analysis here to the four configurations of fig . \n [ fig : system ] , the minimum value obtained is in fact a lower bound of the optimal minimum entanglement .    [ [ measurement ] ] measurement + + + + + + + + + + +    in order to implement the above ideas we need to measure operators of the form ( [ eq : operator ] ) and correlations thereof . while the emerging picture is quite general , we will demonstrate it by resorting to a specific measurement protocol : weakly tunnel - coupling quantum dots ( qds ) to the multi - terminal majorana junction @xcite , and then measuring their charge . \n let us describe the measurement procedure for operators associated with the @xmath25 and @xmath26 majorana sets . \n we correspondingly define @xmath25- and @xmath26- detectors , each consisting of a double quantum dot tunnel - coupled to the three majorana end - states in the set , as shown in fig.[fig : measure ] .    , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) properly coupled to the majorana end - states via tunnel coupling ( dotted lines ) of strength @xmath122 . \n the charge configuration of each dot is detected by a nearby charge sensor , schematically depicted as a quantum point contact . \n the measurement is performed by controlled time pulsed activations of the tunnel coupling @xmath122 . \n [ fig : measure ] ]    the coupling of the @xmath25 detector to the corresponding mbs is given by the hamiltonian @xmath123 where @xmath124 , @xmath125 are the electron destruction operators of each dot of the pair ( all electrons are spin polarized ) and @xmath122 are the tunneling matrix elements between the superconductor s end - points and the quantum dots . \n these dots are tuned such that only one orbital level per dot is relevant at the energy scales considered . \n the charge configuration of the double qd , @xmath126 with @xmath127 can be detected by fast charge sensors , e.g. quantum point contacts @xcite . \n the possibly time dependent tunnel coupling is controlled , e.g. by a nearby gate voltage @xcite . \n one initially prepares the decoupled double qd in a generic superposition of singly occupied levels , @xmath128 , where @xmath129 . \n the tunnel coupling is then switched on for a finite time @xmath130 , and is subsequently switched off . \n the state of the qds may be modified , and the new charge configuration is read out by the charge sensors . specifically we detect the probability , @xmath131 of finding the double dots in the configuration @xmath132    while the strength and the duration of the qds - majorana coupling is adjustable , we consider here , for simplicity , the _ weak measurement _ limit . \n ( going beyond this limit is discussed below @xcite . ) expanding the time evolution , @xmath133 , due to the system - detector coupling for small @xmath130 , and setting for simplicity the initial state of the double qd to @xmath134 and @xmath135 , the measured probability reads @xmath136 to leading order in @xmath137 , @xmath138 . here \n @xmath139 takes the form of eq . \n ( [ eq : operator ] ) with @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 . \n this procedure constitutes a weak measurement of strength @xmath143 of the operator @xmath139 . tuning the parameters @xmath144 and @xmath125 covers all operators of the local algebra of the left ( @xmath25 ) set . \n the same may be repeated to measure the observables represented by the operators @xmath36 of the right set , and the correlated measurements implied by the chsh inequality are therefore executable . specifically , referring to fig . \n [ fig : measure ] , one begins with the configuration @xmath145 . \n tunnel coupling the mbs to the qds , and then sensing their final configuration , the probability to end - up in the @xmath146 is @xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath149 . \n . provides us with a way to evaluate the correlators of the type @xmath150 ( cf . \n eq . ) . \n a few aspects of the measurement procedure are noteworthy . \n we first comment that the operators of the left and of the right set commute . \n it thus follows that they can be measured simultaneously ; non - universal details of the time sequence concerning on - and - off switching of the tunneling matrix elements are immaterial . \n second , the weak limit of the measurement offers a simple and immediate interpretation of the results , however the essence of the analysis remains unchanged at stronger system - detector interaction , although the calibration of the detector may become more involved . \n finally , although the proposed measurement protocol is in principle feasible , it requires control of the individual tunnel matrix elements between the dots and the wires in order to measure different operators . \n this might present an experimental challenge . \n other variants of the protocol may be better suited to experimental implementation . \n for example , the operators needed for this protocol may be designed by controlling individual qd s energy levels , or possibly by majorana - to - charge conversion measurements @xcite .    [ \n [ conclusions ] ] conclusions + + + + + + + + + + +    we have identified a minimal complexity mbs array : a junction with 6 segments delineating an 8-fold degenerate subspace defined by 6 majorana end points . unlike paradigmatic quantum states of two spin-@xmath59 particles that may ( e.g. spin singlet ) or may not ( spin triplet-@xmath151 ) be entangled \n , we have shown that _ any _ state in the 4-dimensional fixed - parity degenerate space ( e.g. , odd parity ) is _ non - locally entangled_. this comes with a minimal bound on the violation of the chsh inequality ( eq . ) . \n we also presented a detector design , amenable to experimental implementation , and showed how to obtain chsh correlation functions . \n specifically , we discussed the limit of a weak measurement protocol . \n this ubiquitous non - locality , expressed through non - local entanglement , reflects the intrinsic property of mbs as carriers of fractionalized fermionic degree of freedom . \n verification of non - local entanglement requires repeated measurements of chsh correlations on replica of the same state , with at least 4 different partitioning ( into @xmath25 and @xmath26 sets ) of the majorana degrees of freedom . \n the chsh inequality will be broken for at least one of these partitioning . \n measuring the operators associated with different partitionings may be achieved through tuning of the majorana - qds couplings , representing non - projective measurements . \n interestingly , a recent work @xcite has used the generation of entanglement to demonstrate how a newly designed gate may extend the possible set of operations with mbss to form a framework for universal quantum computation @xcite . \n generalizations of the present analysis will involve @xmath152 mbs junctions , as well as designs consisting of parafermions . \n we acknowledge support from isf grant 1349/14 , dfg grant ro 2247/8 - 1 , crc 183 of the dfg , the imos israel - russia program , and the minerva foundation . \n 42 natexlab#1#1bibnamefont # 1#1bibfnamefont # 1#1citenamefont # 1#1[2]#2    , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) . \n , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    m. t. deng , s. vaitieknas , e. b. hansen , j. danon , m. leijnse , k. flensberg , j. nygard , p. krogstrup , c. m. marcus , science * 354 * , 1557 ( 2016 ) . \n , , , , , , , , , , , * * , ( ) . \n s. plugge , l. a. landau , e. sela , a. altland , k. flensberg , and r. egger , physical review b,*94 * , 174514 ( 2016 ) . \n s. plugge , a. rasmussen , r. egger , and k. flensberg , new journal of physics * 19 * , ( 2017 ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , , , , arxiv : ( 2016 ) . \n s. vijay , and l. fu , physical review b * 94 * , 235446 ( 2016 ) . \n , , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) \n .    hereafter we refer to entanglement of spatially distinct degrees of freedom .    , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , \n * * , ( ) .    , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) . \n see supplementary material . \n , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , * * , ( ) . \n note that we do not demand here a time - dependent control of the individual tunnel coupling matrix elements , but rather an overall on - and - off switching of the qds - majorana coupling . \n the relative strength of the tunnel couplings @xmath153 can be fixed , e.g. , at the fabrication stage . \n , , , * * , ( ) \n .    it has been shown in ref . that braiding operations on a @xmath154-mbs setup will not be capable of producing entanglement in the computational basis . \n our procedure employs a more general basis .",

    "the genetic diversity of a species is shaped by its recent evolutionary history and can be used to infer demographic events or selective sweeps . \n most inference methods are based on the null hypothesis that natural selection is a weak or infrequent evolutionary force \n . however , many species , particularly pathogens , are under continuous pressure to adapt in response to changing environments . a statistical framework for inference from diversity data of such populations is currently lacking . \n toward this goal , we explore the properties of genealogies in a model of continual adaptation in asexual populations . \n we show that lineages trace back to a small pool of highly fit ancestors , in which almost simultaneous coalescence of more than two lineages frequently occurs . while such multiple mergers are unlikely under the neutral coalescent , they create a unique genetic footprint in adapting populations . \n the site frequency spectrum of derived neutral alleles , for example , is non - monotonic and has a peak at high frequencies , whereas tajima s @xmath0 becomes more and more negative with increasing sample size . \n since multiple merger coalescents emerge in many models of rapid adaptation , we argue that they should be considered as a null - model for adapting populations . \n evolutionary change is usually too slow to be observed in real time . \n a sequence sample represents a static snapshot from which we want to learn about a dynamic evolutionary process . the predominant framework to analyze such population genetic data and infer demographic history \n is kingman s neutral coalescent . within this model , \n all individuals are equivalent , i.e. , there are no fitness differences , and pairs of lineages merge at random . \n the statistical properties of genealogies in this simple population genetic model can be computed exactly  @xcite , facilitating comparison to data . \n one central prediction of the neutral coalescent is that the genetic diversity of a population is proportional to its size . \n this prediction , however , is at odds with the observed weak correlation between genetic diversity and population size , a paradox often remedied by the definition of an effective population size via the genetic diversity . \n the model has been generalized to account for historic changes in population size , mutation rates , geographical structure and the effects of purifying selection @xcite . \n positive selection , however , has proved difficult to incorporate , and progress has been limited to rare selective sweeps @xcite and weak selection @xcite .    in many populations , particularly large microbial populations \n , selection is neither rare nor weak . instead , these populations are under sustained pressure to adapt to changing environments . \n prominent examples include pathogens like influenza that continuously evade human immune responses or hiv , which establishes a chronic infection despite heavy immune predation . \n the genealogical trees reconstructed from sequence samples often suggest substantial departure from neutrality ; see @xcite for examples from viral evolution or @xcite for eukaryotic examples . \n the influenza tree shown in fig . \n [ fig : influenza ] , for instance , is incompatible with a neutral genealogy , since there are parts where many lineages merge in a very brief period , and the tree often branches extremely unevenly with very few individuals on one branch and many on the other . \n these two observations represent fundamental deviations from the standard neutral model , even when a varying population size is allowed . \n strelkowa and lssig present a detailed analysis of influenza a evolution and conclude that influenza is governed by coalescence processes different from the kingman coalescent @xcite .    to analyze and interpret genealogies of populations under sustained directional selection , an alternative simple null model would be extremely useful . \n the features of genealogies discussed above are in fact common to a class of non - kingman coalescence models , which have received considerable attention in the mathematical coalescent literature @xcite . \n a special case is the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent ( bsc ) @xcite , which has been shown to describe the genealogies in models where a population expands into uninhabited territory @xcite . on the basis of a particular exact solution and a phenomenological theory , brunet _ et al . _ \n conjectured that genealogies in all models of the same universality class ( the class of stochastic fisher - kolmogorov - petrovskii - piscounov ( fkpp ) waves @xcite ) are described by the bsc ; see @xcite for a recent review . \n this universality class contains all models with short range dispersal and logistic growth with constant rate in partially filled demes . \n we will argue in this article that the bsc emerges generically in models of rapidly adapting asexual populations in a similar way as it describes genealogies in traveling waves of fkpp type . \n we present extensive computer simulations and investigate the distribution of heterozygosity in the population , the average time to the most recent common ancestor , and the site frequency spectrum ( sfs ) . \n most notably , the sfs is non - monotonic with a large number of high frequency derived alleles . \n we then study a simplified model analytically and show that the underlying genealogical process is approximately the bsc . in the discussion , we outline the basic features of the bsc and discuss its applicability to wider classes of models . \n both trees often branch very unevenly with almost all descendants on the left - most branch . \n while approximate multiple mergers are common in both trees , the influenza tree does not display the uniformly long terminal branches we observe in simulations . \n this could be due to heterogeneous sampling of influenza . \n trees are drawn with figtree http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk / software / figtree/. ]",
    "i generalize the theory of phonon topological band structures of isostatic lattices to frustrated antiferromagnets . \n i achieve this with a discovery of a many - body supersymmetry ( susy ) in the phonon problem of balls and springs and its connection to local constraints satisfied by ground states . \n the witten index of the susy model demands the maxwell - calladine index of mechanical structures . \n `` spontaneous supersymmetry breaking '' is identified as the need to gap all modes in the bulk to create the topological isostatic lattice state . \n since ground states of magnetic systems also satisfy local constraint conditions ( such as the vanishing of the total spin on a triangle ) i identify a similar susy structure for many common models of antiferromagnets including the square , triangluar , kagome , pyrochlore nearest neighbor antiferromagnets , and the @xmath0 square lattice antiferromagnet . remarkably , the kagome family of antiferromagnets is the analog of topological isostatic lattices among this collections of models . \n thus , a solid state realization of the theory of phonon topological band structure may be found in frustrated magnetic materials . \n recently , kane and lubensky@xcite ( kl ) identified topological properties of isostatic lattice phonons . \n they achieved this by discovering a topological index governing mechanical structures by building on calladine s work@xcite and further utilizing a dirac - like square - root of the phonon equations of motion , a problem to which they could apply the theory of topological insulators . \n remarkably , they showed the existence of lattices with gapped phonons for periodic boundary conditions that must have gapless phonons with open boundary conditions . \n it is natural to wonder if this striking effect is more general and they conclude their study with `` finally , it will be interesting to explore connections with theories of frustrated magnetism@xmath1 . '' \n where reference 48 is my study@xcite identifying topological gauge dynamics of the zero modes of classical kagome antiferromagnets . \n this paper s goal is to make this connection and use it to generalize kl theory beyond phonons . \n the kl theory of isostatic lattices is a different branch of topological phases from the theory of topological band insulators . following the original discovery of topological insulators , topological properties of boson band structures \n have been studied for a wide variety of systems including phonons@xcite , photons@xcite , acoustic phononic crystals@xcite and magnons@xcite . \n these systems achieve their topological properties in the presence of time reversal symmetry breaking and are built directly from the physics of the integer quantum hall effect . \n in contrast , kl s theory of isostatic phonons is time reversal symmetric and `` purely geometric in nature''@xcite . \n a connection to the integer quantum hall effect is made only after a dirac - like square - rooting procedure of the equations of motion . \n it therefore presents a new direction in the theory of topological phases . \n remarkably , though its may not apply directly to solid state phonons because they are mechanically stable , the kl theory has already seen a variety of applications due to its insight into the general phenomena of mechanical collapse . \n these include some topological aspects of the jamming and rigidity percolation transitions@xcite , metamaterials made from beams and pins@xcite , and , remarkably , origami@xcite . \n ref . has also taken it beyond the linearized level and discovered solitons that can propagate freely in the bulk of the isostatic state . \n so , given the fundamental insight it provides , any extension of kl theory to a new class of systems , including extensions that go beyond the linearized limit , is likely to shed new light on those systems .    in this light , frustrated magnets and/or \n highly frustrated magnets are a prime target for an extension of kl theory . \n they are magnets not only `` on the verge of collapse '' but also those that have already `` collapsed '' . \n here collapsing is the analog of destabilizing the magnetic ordered state into a paramagnetic state such as a quantum spin liquid or valence bond solid . \n a variety of materials including the organics , kagome family and pyrochlores are heavily studied for this reason@xcite . \n in addition , highly geometrically frustrated magnets have a form of accidental degeneracy that results from a special feature of the spin hamiltoinan@xcite . \n this frustration is toy - like ( fine tuned ) perhaps in a similar way that balls and springs are toy - like versions of a general theory of phonons . \n so if kl theory were applicable to frustrated magnets , this generalization might apply to many already realized solid state materials .    in this paper \n , we show that the key to generalizing kl theory to other systems lies in connecting it to an abstract theoretical framework that takes the form of a many - body supersymmetric ( susy ) structure that extends the description of balls and springs . \n the new fermionic degrees of freedom , that i dub `` phoninos '' , are superpartners to phonons and are governed by the kl theory s square - rooted equations of motion . for linearized phonons , the two sets of degrees of freedom are decoupled . \n the phoninos therefore need not be real degrees of freedom but just reflect the specialness of balls and springs compared to a more general theory of phonons . \n i then show that the topological index identified in kl theory is demanded by the witten index@xcite of susy . \n a similar conclusion was reached by ref . in the continuum limit . \n remarkably , spontaneous susy breaking here is just the need to gap all modes in the bulk to create the topological state ( as could be the case for topological superconductors@xcite ) . finally , we discuss what protects this topology including the role of quantum effects and non - linearities . \n i then apply the same many - body susy construction to the case of magnons . \n it turns out susy is found for both unfrustrated and frustrated magnons for either case has ground states that satisfy local constraints and the susy construction is built on these constraints . \n remarkably , kagome magninos are governed by a hamiltonian which is the dirac s constraint matrix@xcite studied in ref . and is related through susy to the ordinary kagome magnon problem . the witten index in this case \n is then shown to vanish for periodic boundary conditions but not for open boundary conditions demonstrating that kagome magnons are the analog of the isostatic lattice of kl theory if we can gap all their modes without changing topology such as in a distorted kagome crystal . \n such a phase we call isostatic magnetism . \n we conclude by identifying some of the new physical phenomena predicted by these formal development : the design of magnets by exploiting weaknesses in isostatic magnetism such as through a rich set of magnetic field induced spin flip transitions that we call `` self field modes '' ; and an application of the ideas here to the origin of the industrial strength of mn@xmath2ir ( why it is a robust antiferromagnet ) ; the potential application of topological band theory of electrons to magninos in the isostatic magnetic phase and via susy to magnons ; the study of the loss of magnetic order via isostatic magnetism which can be viewed as a classical critical point between magnetic order and a classical spin liquid@xcite / cooperative paramagnet@xcite .",

capita rates of recruitment of types @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and @xmath20 because @xmath11 s higher ses implies a faster rate of entrepreneurial activation through the support of bigger capital and vaster social resources . \n competitive inactivation occurs due to market overlap , or _ \n _ niche overlap__@xcite , as participants can go head - to - head over the same clientele or market . \n an encounter rate @xmath21 , which can be related to the density of the embedding social network , quantifies the probability of market overlaps . \n thus , competitive inactivation is : @xmath22 \n lastly , catalytic inactivation , which denotes the _ network effect _ ( methods ) , is expressed as : @xmath23 the network structure of the mlm catalyses inactivation of existing participants at the rate @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a measure of the probability that two members drawn randomly from the mlm belong to the same type . \n it has been widely used in literature as a diversity index@xcite . due to interconnectedness and homophily@xcite \n , the inactivation of one could ( like a contagion ) infect another to follow suit . \n combining equations  ( [ eq : recruitment]  [ eq : catalytic ] ) results to a master equation ( supplementary equation 1 ) for the state probability density . \n perturbation analysis accounts for the fluctuations arising from demographic stochasticity@xcite . in terms of the system size @xmath26 ( roughly the size of that part of the overall population considered _ fit _ for entrepreneurial activities ) the following ansatz \n is made : @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the average concentrations , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the magnitude of the fluctuations of the stochastic variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively ( supplementary methods , s2 ) . the highest order in the expansion expresses the macroscopic rate equations for @xmath29 and @xmath30 : @xmath33 meanwhile , the next highest order term gives the fokker - planck equation , or fpe ( supplementary equation 2 ) , governing the dynamics of the probability density for the magnitude of the fluctuations . from the fpe , the expectation values of the stationary fluctuations are @xmath34 , which supports the interpretation that the deterministic solutions to  ( [ eq : macroscopic ] ) are the correct average values . \n the model is nondimensionalised by setting the characteristic timescale at @xmath35  days ( methods ) . consequently \n , the rates can be squarely related to empirical data by rescaling to appropriate units . \n dimensionless rates take on simplified yet meaningful values : @xmath36 ; @xmath37 ; and @xmath38 . \n bifurcation analysis ( supplementary methods , s4 ) of the nondimensionalised equation  ( [ eq : macroscopic ] ) unveils a bifurcation manifold @xmath39 , where @xmath40 equation  ( [ eq : bifurcation ] ) coincides with an evolutionarily stable state ( ess ) of a population game between the types ( supplementary methods , s3  s4 ) . \n the fraction of @xmath11  entrepreneurs is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the fluctuation component . \n analysis of the second moments from the fpe shows that the variance diverges as @xmath44 as @xmath45 ( supplementary methods , s5 ) . \n that is a signature of criticality through which the ess , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 , is ( quite counterintuitively ) destabilised as the bifurcation manifold is approached . \n this mechanism is hereby referred as _ \n stochastic tunnelling _ wherein noise enables the state trajectory to cross a phase barrier that could not have been otherwise traversed without actively tuning the bifurcation parameter ( supplementary methods , s4 ) . \n stochastic tunnelling drives the business oscillations ( fig .  2 ) . \n time series is generated by solving the model using a numerical technique , known as gillespie s stochastic simulation algorithm@xcite , which directly integrates the master equation ( supplementary methods , s6 ) . \n diverging variance indeed allows the solution to wander far enough from the ess and closer to an unstable point ( uep ) which pushes that solution toward the boundary state , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( fig . \n 2a ) . \n that noise also enables the solution to sling back to the ess consequently forming loops in the phase portrait , hence , oscillations in the time series ( fig . \n 2b ) . \n the time series consist of upswings associated with increasing diversity and downswings with decreasing diversity , i.e. , @xmath50 as @xmath51 . \n the remarkable observation is that recovery from low points of the series coincide with periods when @xmath11 is dominant  a case of the fitter entrepreneurs surviving through  recessions\"@xcite . \n profit maximisation is an axiom of capitalist enterprise@xcite . \n mlm may enhance profitability by maximising the proportion of @xmath11    entrepreneurs ( supplementary methods , s7 ) . \n thus , the time - average value @xmath52 is examined for various pairs of @xmath18 and @xmath53 which consequently depicts the phase diagram of the model ( fig . \n 3a ) . \n business oscillations come about as a result of stochastic tunnelling through the critical boundary @xmath54 . \n phase ii , where @xmath11 stably dominates ( supplementary fig . \n s2b ) , can be considered pareto - optimal as the mlm maximises profitability as a whole . \n but high levels of targeted recruitment , i.e. , @xmath55 , are required . \n entrepreneurial activation , however , might in reality be less discriminatory and thus @xmath56 , which denotes higher entropy ( supplementary discussion ) . \n the critical boundary delineates , for any magnitude @xmath53 of the network effect , the minimum @xmath18 that promotes long - run dominance of @xmath11    entrepreneurs . \n nevertheless , a stronger network effect tends to frustrate that dominance as catalytic inactivation increasingly outpaces activation , leading to degradation of entrepreneurial activity ( supplementary fig . \n s2d ) . \n the ess at the iii -

world mlms are pareto - dominated economic systems@xcite , which are operating in an environment characterised by high entropy , i.e. , @xmath56 , and by a strong network effect ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) . \n the study paints an illuminating insight about the nature of mlm operations . \n mlms have been accused in several instances by discontent participants for ethical violations concerning its business practices@xcite . \n the model justifies such disgruntlement for two reasons . \n first , that profit is closely associated with recruitment implies less selective entrepreneurial activation . \n second , that recruitment proceeds through embedded networks connotes strong network effects . \n less - fit entrepreneurs can join the market in droves but are weeded out too soon@xcite because of the pareto - dominated nature of the venture . \n the feeling of being victimised is thus not at all surprising . \n the mesoeconomic framework ( i.e. , linking microeconomic foundations with macroeconomic phenomena@xcite ) puts the present study in a broader economic context . a more network -

orbit band , and observe a subsequent dipole motion . \n our experimental results are corroborated by a theoretical and numerical analysis and showcase the great flexibility that ultra - cold atoms provide for investigating rich spin dynamics in superfluids .                    _ \n introduction_.the zitterbewegung ( zb ) oscillation , first predicted by schrdinger in 1930 @xcite for relativistic dirac electrons , describes the fast oscillation or trembling motion of electrons arising from the interference between particle and hole components of dirac spinors . \n although fundamentally important , the zb oscillation is difficult to observe in real particles . in the past eight decades , analogs of the zb oscillation \n have been predicted to exist in various physical systems zbgraphene , zbgeim , zbti , zbsemiconductor , zbatom , zbdamp , ions - solano , ranging from solid state ( _ e.g. _ , semiconductor quantum wells ) to trapped cold atoms , but experimentally a zb analog has only recently been observed using trapped ions as a quantum emulator of the dirac equation @xcite . \n a crucial ingredient for the zb oscillation is the coupling between spin and linear momentum of particles , leading to simultaneous velocity and position oscillations accompanying the spin oscillation , which distinguishes zb from rabi oscillations where spin oscillations between two bands do not induce velocity and position oscillations . \n ultra - cold atomic gases provide a very promising setting for emulating interesting quantum phenomena because of the high tunability of system parameters as well as the direct imaging of atomic velocities and positions . \n for instance , recent experiments have succeeded in the realization of spin - orbit ( so ) coupling in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) and degenerate fermi gases ( dfgs ) @xcite . \n while so coupling plays a prominent role in many important condensed - matter phenomena @xcite , its realization in neutral atom superfluids is novel and provides a powerful experimental platform due to a rich ground state phase diagram , intriguing equilibrium and non - equilibrium spin dynamics and the presence of many - body interactions gs1,gs2,gs3,gs4,gs5,gs6,gs7,gs8,gs9,gs10,gs11,gs12,gs13,gs14 . \n as we show in this letter so coupling in a bec makes it possible to observe zb oscillations in neutral atomic gases . to induce zb oscillation in a so coupled bec , we exploit quantum quenches of the hamiltonian . \n the study of quenches and many - body dynamics far from equilibrium has emerged as an important frontier in many branches of physics quench2,quench3,quench , ising , ising2,ising3,fermion , bh , iso , including cold atomic gases . \n we observe short - time coherent zb oscillations as well as long time zb damping as a consequence of such quenches . \n our main observations are the following :    \\(i ) on a short time scale ( @xmath0 ms ) , a quantum quench couples two so bands , leading to simultaneous spin and velocity oscillations of the bec that can be interpreted as zb oscillation . here \n the two so bands effectively mimic the particle and hole branches of the dirac equation , and the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy splitting between the two bands . \n \\(ii ) on a long time scale ( @xmath1 ms ) , the amplitude of the zb oscillation damps out because of the diminishing overlap of the two wavepackets as they move with different group velocities in the two bands . \n the many - body interactions between atoms reduce the damping of the oscillation amplitude . after the zb oscillation damps out , a subsequent dipole motion is accompanied by sudden and strong heating of the bec . \n \\(iii ) the zb oscillation can be used to load a bec into the upper so band . as a result \n , we observe dipole motion of the bec in the upper band as well as the accompanying change in spin composition .    _ experimental methods and theoretical model_.our experiments are conducted with becs of @xmath2rb of about @xmath3 atoms confined in a trapping potential with trapping frequency @xmath4  hz , where the value of @xmath5 depends on the intensity of the raman beams ( thus @xmath6 ) as well as on a crossed dipole beam . \n two crossed raman lasers with wavelengths near @xmath7 nm propagate along the @xmath8 direction ( relative angle @xmath9 ) , respectively . \n we apply a magnetic bias field of 10  g in the @xmath10 direction ( so coupling direction ) as shown in fig . \n [ intro]a . \n the resulting quadratic zeeman splitting for the @xmath11 manifold @xmath12 is @xmath13 , which is sufficiently large such that the contribution of the hyperfine state @xmath14 can mostly be neglected , yielding an effective spin-1/2 system with the pseudo -

heff ] ) , \n the center of mass motion of the atomic wavepacket is given by @xcite @xmath51where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the velocities of the two components . \n therefore the oscillating spin polarization @xmath54 leads to the oscillation of the velocity @xmath55 ( the quasi - momentum @xmath56 is roughly a constant on the short time scale ) . \n the velocity is directly observed in our experiment shown in fig . \n [ zb]a following a jump of @xmath24 from @xmath45 to @xmath46 with @xmath44 . here \n the dynamics are characterized by a rapid population oscillation between the @xmath57 and @xmath58 spin states with a momentum transfer of 2@xmath59 as seen in fig . \n zbc . \n the frequency of the zb oscillation is determined by the energy splitting between two so bands . for the chosen parameters the oscillations occur at a frequency of 3.62@xmath60 and \n can be observed for many cycles . \n the quasi - momentum remains relatively constant over this time scale . \n the dependence of the velocity oscillation frequency on the parameter @xmath24 is plotted in fig . \n [ zb]d along with the band excitation frequency and the results from numerical simulations of the nonlinear g - p equation si . \n clearly the oscillation frequency is well described by the energy splitting between the lower and upper band . \n the velocity oscillation amplitude is bounded by @xmath61 mm / s @xcite . due to the similarity between the effective two - band model in eq . \n ( [ eq - heff ] ) and the dirac - like equation , the observed velocity oscillation is a low - temperature analog to the well - known zb oscillation theoretically studied in various systems @xcite , but only observed previously in @xcite . \n the occurrence of such oscillations is not unique to quenches of @xmath24 . \n for instance , we have observed similar velocity oscillation for jumping @xmath6 to @xmath40 ( see fig . fig -

body effects also affect the damping by expanding the wave function in real space and narrowing it in momentum space , leading to a reduced damping effect on both short and long time scales as seen in figs . \n [ zb]b and fig -

delayed onset]a and [ fig - delayed onset]b . \n note that the zb oscillation , which typically damps out on the time scale of a few ms , is present in these cases as well but is not resolved in the experimental data shown in this figure due to the chosen 1  ms time steps . \n the delayed onset of the dipole motion is also observed in the numerics and is related to the geometry of the band structure . for a small value of the raman coupling , the region of the lower band after the quench of @xmath24 near \n the initial bec quasimomentum is relatively flat , implying a small initial group velocity . \n we have verified in our numerics that for a larger raman coupling , there is no such delayed onset . \n the observed strong heating is also related to the geometry of the band structure : unlike the bec in the lower band , the bec in the upper band has a large initial group velocity . \n by @xmath72 ms the zb oscillation damps out after there is no longer any overlap of the components in the two bands in real space . \n subsequently the wave packet in the upper band turns around because of the trap , and its collision with atoms in the lower band leads to excitations of many momentum modes @xcite , as seen in fig . \n fig - delayed onsetc for 11.5 ms . \n the fact that the bec in the lower band enters a negative effective mass region of the band structure may also contribute to the excitations . \n after the zb oscillations damp out , the bec continues to move within the quenched band structure and performs dipole oscillations @xcite with strong spin relaxation @xcite . \n such subsequent spin relaxation to the potential minimum in the presence of many - body interaction between atoms is different from that in solid state systems originating from the scattering from impurities . in our experiments , \n the dipole oscillations occur as a consequence of the quantum quench , with the initial wave packets in both lower and upper so bands . \n the stability and relaxation of this large amplitude dipole oscillation has not been studied before . \n an example of the dynamics in the subsequent dipole oscillations is shown in the supplementary material @xcite .     where @xmath73 and @xmath63 . \n a)experimentally observed zb oscillation ( open circles ) after a single phase jump , and corresponding numerical simulations ( solid line ) for experimental conditions . \n b ) the time sequence . \n c -

upper band]b ) . \n we experimentally investigate this procedure using @xmath76 and @xmath24 @xmath77 , inciting large zb oscillation amplitudes by a phase jump of @xmath39 of the raman fields , as seen in fig . \n [ fig - upper band]a . \n when the phase change is reversed by a second jump at @xmath78s , we load approximately 80@xmath79 of the bec into the upper band near @xmath65 . \n this is in agreement with an argument based on the corresponding transformations in the bloch sphere . \n as the population transfer is not unity for these chosen parameters , there will be a small residual zb oscillation after the second jump . \n allowing an evolution time @xmath80 , the bec undergoes dipole motion while it gradually melts . the quasi - momentum and the spin polarization , defined as @xmath81 for the component of the bec in the upper band \n are plotted in figs . \n [ fig - upper band]c and fig - upper bandd . \n the change in spin polarization with quasi - momentum is consistent with the prediction from the single particle model . for this calculation \n we fit the quasi - momentum measurement with a polynomial ( shown as a line in fig . \n [ fig - upper band]c ) . using the single particle band structure \n we then calculate the corresponding spin polarization ( shown as a line in fig . \n [ fig - upper band]d ) . \n the good agreement with the experimental data indicates the spinfulness of the upper band .    _ \n summary_.in summary , we observe zb oscillations of neutral atoms for the first time through quenching a spin - orbit coupled bec . \n we find that many - body interaction between atoms plays an important role for zb oscillations and their decay . \n the results presented in this work showcase the exceptional flexibility that cold atoms provide for the study of quantum spin dynamics in spin -

    "density fluctuations resulting from spinodal decomposition in a non - equilibrium first - order chiral phase transition are explored . \n we show that such instabilities generate divergent fluctuations of conserved charges along the isothermal spinodal lines appearing in the coexistence region . \n thus , divergent density fluctuations could be a signal not only for the critical end point but also for the first order phase transition expected in strongly interacting matter . \n we also compute the mean - field critical exponent at the spinodal lines . \n our analysis is performed in the mean - field approximation to the njl model formulated at finite temperature and density . however , our main conclusions are expected to be generic and model independent . \n one of the central questions addressed in the context of qcd is the phase structure and the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter at finite temperature and baryon number density @xcite . \n based on calculations in effective models and on universality arguments one finds that the order of the transition from the hadronic to the quark gluon plasma phase depends on the number of quark flavors and on the value of the quark masses  @xcite . for physical values of the parameters \n one expects that the transition at high temperature and low net baryon number density is continuous . in the opposite limit of low temperature and large density \n the qcd phase transition is expected to be first order . \n this suggests that the phase diagram exhibits a critical end point ( cep ) , where the first order chiral transition of qcd terminates @xcite . \n recent , however still preliminary , results obtained in first principle calculations of qcd , in lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) , confirm the existence of such a point in the temperature t and chemical potential @xmath0 plane @xcite . \n the search for the cep has recently attracted considerable attention . \n it is of particular interest to identify the position of the critical end point in the phase diagram and to study generic properties of thermodynamic quantities in its vicinity . \n the qualitative behavior of physical observables and their dependence on thermodynamic variables in the critical region can be studied in effective chiral models . however \n , a quantitative description of the thermodynamics near the phase transition can only be obtained theoretically by solving qcd _ ab initio _ in lgt or phenomenologically in the context of experimental studies of heavy ion collisions .    to locate the phase transition line in the qcd phase diagram one needs observables that are sensitive probes of the critical structure . \n modifications in the magnitude of fluctuations or the corresponding susceptibilities have been suggested as a possible signal for deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration @xcite . in this context , fluctuations related to conserved charges are of particular interest @xcite . \n the fluctuations of baryon number and electric charge diverge at the critical end point while they are finite along the cross over and first order phase boundaries @xcite . \n consequently , singular fluctuations of baryon number and electric charge as well as a non monotonic behavior of these fluctuations as functions of the collision energy in heavy ion collisions have been proposed as possible signals for the qcd critical end point @xcite . however , the finiteness of the fluctuations along the first order transition depend on the assumption that this transition appears in equilibrium .    a first order phase transition is intimately linked with the existence of a convex anomaly in the thermodynamic pressure @xcite , which can be uncovered only in non - equilibrium systems . \n there is an interval of energy density or baryon number density where the derivative of the pressure is positive , @xmath1 . \n this anomalous behavior characterizes a region of instability in the ( @xmath2-plane , where @xmath3 is the net quark number density . \n this region is bounded by the spinodal lines , where the pressure derivative with respect to volume vanishes . \n the derivative taken at constant temperature and that taken at constant entropy define the isothermal and isentropic spinodal lines , respectively . \n the consequences of spinodal decomposition have been discussed in connection with the chiral / deconfinement phase transition in heavy ion collisions @xcite . \n furthermore , spinodal decomposition plays a crucial role in the description of the 1st order nuclear liquid - gas transition in low energy nuclear collisions @xcite . \n it has also been argued that in the region of phase coexistence , a phase separation can lead to an enhancement of baryon @xcite and strangeness fluctuations @xcite .    in this letter \n we consider the fluctuations of conserved charges along the spinodal lines , expected at finite net baryon density in the qcd phase diagram . \n we show that if the chiral phase transition is first order , then the fluctuations of the net densities of baryon number and electric charge diverge along the isothermal spinodal lines . \n consequently , large fluctuations of these quantities may be a signal for a first order phase transition in the qcd medium . \n we also compute the mean - field critical exponent of the quark susceptibility at the spinodal lines and compare with that at the cep .    in our study of fluctuations across the first order chiral phase transition \n we adopt the nambu  jona -

equilibrium first order phase transition , the system supercools / superheats and , if driven sufficiently far from equilibrium , it becomes unstable due to the convex anomaly in the thermodynamic pressure . \n in other words , in the coexistence region there is a range of densities and temperatures , bounded by the spinodal lines , where the spatially uniform system is mechanically unstable . \n the location of the spinodal lines is determined by the conditions    @xmath20    for the isothermal and isentropic spinodal lines , respectively . \n both these lines are shown in fig . \n 1 . from the thermodynamic relation @xmath21 ^ 2\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is clear that the isentropic spinodal lines are located inside the instability region bounded by the isothermal spinodals and that the two sets of lines coincide at @xmath22 . in the mean field approximation \n the isothermal instabilities disappear at the cep , where the first order transition ends , while the isentropic spinodal curves join below the cep . \n we note that the isentropic spinodal lines will probably be modified considerably when fluctuations are properly included . \n this is because the specific heat @xmath23 diverges at the cep @xcite , while in the mean - field approximation it remains finite . \n it then follows from @xmath24 that both the isothermal and the isentropic pressure derivatives in @xmath25 vanish at the cep . \n consequently , in a more complete description , the isentropic spinodal lines are expected to move up in temperature and to also join at the cep .    since the isothermal spinodal lines join at the cep , as shown in fig . \n 1 , it is natural to explore how the charge fluctuations develop when going beyond the critical end point into the first order phase transition . in fig . \n 2 we show the evolution of the net quark number fluctuations along a path of fixed @xmath26 mev in the @xmath27plane . when entering the coexistence region , there is a singularity in @xmath28 that appears when crossing the isothermal spinodal lines , where the fluctuations diverge and the susceptibility changes sign . between the spinodal lines , \n the susceptibility is negative . \n this implies an instability of the baryon number fluctuations when crossing the transition between the chirally symmetric and broken phases .     the net quark number density fluctuations @xmath29 as a function of the quark number density @xmath3 across the first order phase transition . \n the susceptibility @xmath28 was computed in the njl model along the line of constant temperature @xmath26 mev . \n , width=325 ]     in the stable and meta stable regions , as a function of the quark number density @xmath3 and temperature t. the full line corresponds to the critical temperature @xmath30 , and the dashed lines to the temperatures 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 75 and 80 mev . \n the dotted line shows the projection of the isothermal spinodal onto the @xmath27 plane.,width=321,height=222 ]    an estimate of the growth rate for unstable density fluctuations , assuming a typical wave vector @xmath31 mev and using the results of  @xcite for the collisionless regime , yields a characteristic growth time @xmath32 fm in agreement with  @xcite . \n we note that the detailed calculations of ref . \n @xcite show that the growth rates of the most unstable mode deep inside the spinodal region depends only weakly on the collision rate . \n thus , our estimate is expected to be valid also in the intermediate and hydrodynamic regimes . within the growth time \n an initial fluctuation grows by a factor @xmath33 . \n since this time is smaller than or on the order of the typical expansion time scale in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , we conclude that the spinodal instability may lead to observable fluctuations . \n a more quantitative estimate of the expected fluctuations in heavy - ion collisions would require a kinetic calculation , e.g. along the lines of ref . \n @xcite . \n the behavior of @xmath28 seen in fig . \n 2 is a direct consequence of the thermodynamic relations @xmath34 which connect the pressure derivatives with the susceptibilities @xmath35 . along the isothermal spinodal lines the pressure derivative in ( [ eq7 ] ) vanishes . \n thus , for non - vanishing density @xmath3 , @xmath28 must diverge to satisfy ( [ eq7 ] ) . \n furthermore , since the pressure derivative @xmath36 changes sign when crossing the spinodal line , there must be a corresponding sign change in @xmath28 , as seen in fig . \n 2 . due to the linear relation between @xmath28 , the isovector susceptibility @xmath37 and the charge susceptibility @xmath38  @xcite , the charge fluctuations are also divergent at the isothermal spinodal line . thus , in heavy - ion collisions , fluctuations of the baryon number and electric charge could show enhanced fluctuations , as a signal of the spinodal decomposition . \n the spinodal phase separation can also lead to fluctuations in strangeness @xcite and isospin densities @xcite .    at the isentropic spinodal line the baryon number susceptibility is in general finite . \n this is also true for the other susceptibilities appearing in eq . \n ( [ eq8 ] ) . \n the isentropic spinodal line ( [ eq5 ] ) corresponds to a zero of the numerator in ( [ eq8 ] ) and of the velocity of hydrodynamic sound waves . in the hydrodynamic limit the instability sets in at the isothermal spinodal , but the growth rate becomes large only at the isentropic spinodal line  @xcite .    in the case of an equilibrium first order phase transition , the density fluctuations do not diverge ; in the coexistence region the susceptibility is a linear combination of the positive susceptibilities above and below the phase boundary . \n thus , the fluctuations increase as one approaches the cep along the first order transition and decrease again in the cross over region . \n this led to the prediction of a non - monotonous behavior of the fluctuations with increasing beam energy as a signal for the existence of a cep  @xcite . \n we stress that strictly speaking this is relevant only for the idealized situation where the first order phase transition takes place in equilibrium . in the more realistic non - equilibrium system one expects fluctuations in a larger region of the phase diagram , i.e. , over a broader range of beam energies , due to the spinodal instabilities . \n the critical exponent at the isothermal spinodal line is found to be @xmath39 , with @xmath40 , while @xmath41 at the cep , in agreement with the mean -

equilibrium systems , created e.g. in heavy ion collisions . \n this means that large fluctuations of the density is expected not only at the second order critical end point but also at a non - equilibrium first order transition . \n in fact , the signal from the first - order transition may be much stronger than that from the cep . \n model calculations suggest that the critical region of enhanced susceptibility around the cep is fairly small  @xcite , while it is large in the spinodal region , where the fluctuations appear due to the divergence of @xmath28 and due to the mechanical instability of the system . \n we stress that there is a close relation between the singularities at the cep and the spinodal lines . \n the properties of different susceptibilities were obtained within the njl model in the mean field approximation . \n however , the singular properties of charge susceptibilities in the presence of spinodal instabilities are quite general . \n they appear due to the straightforward thermodynamic relation between the pressure derivatives and charge susceptibilities . \n thus , although the njl model is non -

    "the chiral aiii symmetry class in the periodic table of topological insulators contains topological phases classified by a winding number @xmath0 for each odd space - dimension . \n an open problem for this class is the characterization of the phases and phase - boundaries in the presence of strong disorder . in this work , \n we derive a covariant real - space formula for @xmath0 and , using an explicit 1-dimensional disordered topological model , we show that @xmath0 remains quantized and non - fluctuating when disorder is turned on , even though the bulk energy - spectrum is _ \n completely localized_. furthermore , @xmath0 remains robust even after the insulating gap is filled with localized states , but when the disorder is increased even further , an abrupt change of @xmath0 to a trivial value is observed . using exact analytic calculations , we show that this marks a critical point where the localization length diverges . \n as such , in the presence of disorder , the aiii class displays markedly different physics from everything known to date , with robust invariants being carried entirely by localized states and bulk extended states emerging from an absolutely localized spectrum . \n detailed maps and a clear physical description of the phases and phase boundaries are presented based on numerical and exact analytic calculations .    in the periodic classification table of topological insulators and superconductors \n @xcite , the unitary class a , which includes integer quantum hall insulators , is arguably the most well - understood class , especially in the presence of disorder . here , in even space - dimensions , \n the topological phases are characterized by the topologically invariant chern numbers @xcite . \n these topological integers are explicitly known to be robust against disorder @xcite , that is , they can not jump between different quantized values unless the fermi level crosses a region of extended quantum states @xcite . \n consequently , phases with different chern numbers are necessarily separated by phase - boundaries carrying extended bulk states . \n furthermore , the chern numbers are known to be carried by bulk extended states that are embedded within a large set of localized states . when the disorder is increased , the systems in class a undergoe the  levitation and annihilation \" process where the bulk extended states above and below the fermi level levitate toward one another in the energy spectrum and then annihilate upon collision , leading to topological phase transitions . this complete picture that we have for class a \n is very often assumed to apply to all symmetry classes in the periodic table since it has been observed in several different symmetry classes @xcite . \n looking over the periodic table , one immediately notices that the aiii chiral - unitary class is the natural complement of the a unitary class , but in odd space - dimensions @xcite . in this letter \n , we demonstrate that the disorder - driven topological phase transitions in the aiii symmetry class can be strikingly different . for a generic 1-dimensional ( 1d ) two - band model in aiii - class , we use well established methods to show that the bulk energy spectrum harbors no extended states . yet , by using a covariant real - space representation of the integer - valued winding number @xmath0 , which characterizes the different phases in the aiii - class , we find that @xmath0 remains quantized and non - fluctuating , even after the disorder completely fills the spectral gap with localized states . after increasing the disorder strength even further , a sharp transition is observed where @xmath0 drops from the topological to the trivial value . using exact analytics , which are also confirmed by numerics , \n we demonstrate that the localization length of the disordered model diverges at this transition point . \n our findings demonstrate that robust topological numbers ( even integer - valued invariants ) can be carried entirely by _ localized states _ , and that disorder can drive the _ completely localized _ topological phase through a _ \n delocalized _ critical point , in striking contrast to what has been observed so far for disordered topological insulators . \n ( eq .

symmetric system can be adiabatically deformed into an independent sum of @xmath20-band models like eq . \n [ model ] . \n we begin with the analysis of the model in the clean limit @xmath21 . \n the bloch hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath22 which obeys @xmath23 . \n being in class aiii , the topological invariant of the model is given by the winding number of the off - diagonal part of @xmath24 @xcite : @xmath25 from which the residue theorem gives @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 otherwise . \n we note that the bulk energy - gap closes precisely at @xmath29 , which signals the topological phase transitions in the clean system . in general \n , @xmath0 can take on any integer value and is gauge - invariant under a change of phase of the bloch wavefunctions . \n if @xmath30 denote the numbers of bound states of each chirality at one end of an open chain , then topology enforces the bulk - edge correspondence : @xmath31    one can find an additional physical interpretation of @xmath0 by noticing that it can be generically re - written as a  skew - polarization : \" @xmath32where @xmath33 is the bloch function for band @xmath34 the skew - polarization is gauge - invariant precisely because @xmath33 and @xmath35 are orthogonal . \n for 1d topological insulators , one is probably more familiar with the standard electric polarization @xcite : @xmath36 which is not gauge invariant but can change by an integer under gauge transformations . since @xmath37 , the polarizations of the negative and positive energy bands are equal . and since the polarization of a system with all bands filled must be an integer , this implies that @xmath38 , and thus @xmath39 is quantized in units of @xmath40 in class aiii . in the supplementary information , \n we show that @xmath41 , which gives a new physical interpretation for @xmath0 .    in 1d \n , there is no obstruction to defining localized wannier functions from the occupied states in an insulating phase @xcite , even if topological . in our case , setting @xmath42 places the system deep in the topological phase and the bloch wavefunctions become @xmath43 from the set of occupied bloch functions @xmath44 , we can explicitly construct a set of ultra - localized wannier functions near each site @xmath7 : @xmath45 , having weight only on two neighboring sites . \n when the system is tuned away from @xmath42 , but still in the topological phase , the wannier functions @xmath46 will gradually spread but still remain exponentially localized at the mid - bond between sites @xmath7 and @xmath47 . \n it is then somewhat surprising that this system , and , in fact , all 1d topological insulator / superconductor phases can support a non - trivial integer topological invariant , even though the occupied space can be represented entirely using localized bulk states . \n additionally , the well - known levitation - annihilation process for disorder - driven topological phase transitions in free - fermion topological phases can not possibly apply here because there are no delocalized bulk modes which carry the topological invariant . instead , each single - particle electron state carries part of the topological invariant , and because of this , a different type of disorder - driven transition must occur as we now discuss .    ) in the 3-dimensional phase space @xmath48 . \n the lines ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) represent the singular points where the scaling is anomalous ( see text ) . \n the next panels report maps of the winding number ( b , c ) and localization length ( d , e ) as computed with eqs . \n [ rwindingnr ] and with the numerical transfer matrix method , respectively , for two sections of the phase space defined by the constraints @xmath49 ( b , d ) and @xmath50 ( c , e ) . \n the analytic critical curves are shown as black / white lines in panels ( b , c)/(d , e ) , respectively . \n the computations of @xmath0 were done for @xmath51 and averaged over 10 disorder configurations . \n the transfer matrix was iterated @xmath52 times.,width=302 ]    we begin by deriving a covariant , real - space representation of the winding number defined in eq . \n [ kwindingnr ] . \n such a real space representation is essential because it remains well - defined in the presence of disorder and can be evaluated with extreme precision using the methods elaborated in refs . \n @xcite . for the derivation , it is more convenient to work with the homotopically equivalent flat band version of the hamiltonian : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 are the spectral projection operators onto the spectrum above / below @xmath55 since @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the eigenvalues of the chiral transformation are @xmath58 , hence @xmath59 , with @xmath60 being the projectors for the @xmath58 eigenvalues . \n any chiral - symmetric operator , in particular q , decomposes as : @xmath61 and the following relations are always true : @xmath62 these provide the covariant , real - space form of the off - diagonal term ( and its inverse ) entering the winding number formula : @xmath63 by recalling that @xmath64 for a generic translational invariant operator @xmath10 can be represented in real - space as a trace per volume ( denoted by @xmath65 here ) , and that @xmath66 is equal to the commutator @xmath67 $ ] in real - space ( @xmath68 the position operator ) , one can fully formulate the winding number in the real - space : @xmath69 \\big \\}.\\ ] ] following the same reasoning , one can derive a general covariant real - space representation of the invariant for the aiii - class in arbitrary @xmath70-dimensions : @xmath71 \\right \\},\\ ] ] where the summation is over all possible permutations @xmath72 of the indices . \n these real - space formulas can be evaluated in the presence of disorder , and is important to note that eq . \n [ grwindingnr ] is self - averaging , that is , the result of a computation is independent of the disorder configuration being used . for some disordered 1d topological phases one can formulate a topological invariant using transfer matrices as well@xcite .    to be concrete , we fix @xmath50 in which case @xmath73 at @xmath21 , and @xmath74 in the limit @xmath75 because the onsite potential commutes with @xmath76 . \n this signals a possible topological phase transition which we explored with eq . \n [ rwindingnr ] . the behavior of @xmath0 with increasing disorder is reported in fig . \n [ invariantvsw ] . here , one sees the winding number staying quantized and non - fluctuating even after the spectral gap closes from the strong disorder ( no disorder averaging is necessary ) . upon further increase of disorder \n , an abrupt switch occurs from the topological @xmath73 to the trivial @xmath28 value , accompanied by strong fluctuations during the transition period . \n this behavior leaves little doubt that a topological critical point is lurking underneath .    in order for @xmath0 to change values \n , there must be delocalized states appearing at the fermi - level , which , for chiral symmetry , is at @xmath55 due to a simplification occurring precisely at @xmath77 , the localization length of the disordered model and the critical exponents at the critical point can be computed exactly . \n indeed , the schrodinger equation @xmath78 reads : @xmath79 , where @xmath80 represents a and b site , respectively . \n the solution is : @xmath81 where @xmath82 for @xmath83 , respectively . \n the inverse of the localization length @xmath84 is given by : @xmath85 \\medskip \\\\ \n \\indent = \\big |\\lim\\limits_{n\\rightarrow \\infty } \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(\\ln |t_j|-\\ln|m_j|)\\big | . \\end{array}\\ ] ] according to birkhoff s ergodic theorem , we can use the ensemble average to evaluate the last expression : @xmath86 the integrations can be performed explicitly , and in the regime of large @xmath87 s where the arguments of the logarithms can become negative , we obtain : @xmath88 \\right |.\\ ] ] using numerical transfer matrix and level - statistics analysis we combed the energy spectrum and found that , in every instance , all the states at @xmath89 are localized . \n hence , for the critical behavior , we can focus exclusively on the case @xmath55 this enables us to use eq . \n [ loclength1 ] to draw the exact phase diagram in the 3-dimensional parameter space @xmath90 by tracing the critical surface @xmath91 where @xmath92 . \n the result is shown in fig . \n [ criticalsurface](a ) , which reveals that we are indeed dealing with two phases that are completely disconnected from each other . \n we can show that the phase inside @xmath91 is a topological phase with @xmath73 while outside @xmath91 , @xmath28 . as examples , in figs . \n [ criticalsurface](b , c ) we show calculations of @xmath0 from eq . \n [ rwindingnr ] for the sections defined by @xmath93 and @xmath50 , respectively , which confirms that the topological phase @xmath73 extends all the way to the critical line , beyond which @xmath0 shifts abruptly to zero . by using the transfer matrix method @xcite , \n the localization length was also obtained numerically in figs . \n 2(d , e ) , where one can see a diverging critical line that matches perfectly the analytic critical line from eq . ( [ loclength1 ] ) . eq . \n [ loclength1 ] also enables us to determine the critical exponent for the transition . \n let @xmath94 be a point on @xmath91 . \n we can cross @xmath91 by varying any of the three parameters , so let us vary @xmath95 in a small interval @xmath96 $ ] . \n as shown in the supplementary information @xmath97 $ ] , which gives a critical exponent 1 , except along lines ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) shown in fig . \n [ criticalsurface](a ) where the scaling has a logarithmic correction @xmath98    to find the physical origin of the topological phase transition , we map eq . \n [ model ] to a spin-@xmath40 hamiltonian defined on a lattice of size @xmath99 via the jordan - wigner transformation @xmath100 where @xmath101 are spin-@xmath40 variables and @xmath102 is the kink operator . \n these transformations lead to a hamiltonian @xmath103 which is the spin-@xmath40 xx model with random exchange couplings @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) between the even ( odd ) bonds . \n the simple form of the ground - state in the spin - representation can simplify the real - space description of the topological characterization . \n the ground state can be constructed by a real - space renormalization group ( rg ) procedure which is asymptotically exact@xcite . \n each rg step consists of decimating the pair of spins that have the strongest exchange interaction by enforcing a spin - singlet state for that pair , and correspondingly generating a new and weaker bond between the neighboring spins . \n the final result is the ground state in which each spin forms a singlet state with another spin in the system . for the generic case in which the distributions @xmath106 and @xmath107 are chosen to be different , the system is gapped and said to be dimerized@xcite . roughly speaking \n , the topological and trivial phases correspond to dimerization patterns on either the odd or even bonds , and these patterns are preserved during each rg step .    by the nature of the rg procedure \n , the singlets that are generated never cross each other , which implies that every singlet state in the ground state will be formed by one spin belonging to sublattice @xmath10 and another spin belonging to sublattice @xmath11 ( a manifestation of the underlying chiral symmetry ) . \n let us associate to the @xmath108-th singlet a pair of numbers @xmath109 which are the lattice sites of the two spins in the singlet . \n the ground state is @xmath110{| \\downarrow \\ldots \\downarrow \\rangle}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we map back to the fermion representation the ground state can be simplified to @xmath111{| 0 \\rangle}$ ] where @xmath112 and @xmath113 have unit modulus and depend on the configuration of the singlets ( see supplementary information ) . \n this form of the ground state is remarkable because it is a product state constructed from the single - particle states @xmath114 which , like the flat - band limit in the disorder - free system , only have weight on two sites ( although now the sites can be far apart ) . in this basis , the real - space winding number formula drastically simplifies to @xmath115 which is just the sum of vectors connecting the end - points of the singlets . in the clean topological phase @xmath116 and @xmath117 , as expected . \n by contrast , in the trivial phase , singlets form onsite , which implies @xmath118 . \n this clearly illustrates that it is not a single de - localized state which carries the topological winding number , but instead , the entire set of occupied states \n . we could adiabatically deform the hamiltonian , while preserving chiral symmetry , so that states of the form @xmath119 become the single - particle eigenstates and then _ each _ state would carry a portion @xmath120 of @xmath121    we can further exploit the mapping to the spin model to understand the nature of the topological phase transition . \n consider disordering a state that is dimerized on the even bonds ( i.e. the topological state ) . from the rg procedure \n , one can see that disorder will favour the formation of regions that dimerize on the odd bonds , so that trivial and topological regions coexist . \n in the vicinity of the critical point , the low - energy interface states formed between these regions contribute to the spectral density inside the energy gap . \n this type of behavior corresponds to a griffiths phase @xcite , which is not critical and thus explains why the topological invariant does not change at the gap closing point . \n the system becomes critical when dimerization occurs equally on both the odd and even bonds , leading to a proliferation of zero - energy interface states . as a result , both the localization length as well as \n the density of states become divergent at zero energy [ ] . \n similar physics , albeit in a different context involving superconducting wires , was discussed in refs . , both of which are important precursors for our work . \n the critical point realizes the random singlet ( rs ) phase in which singlets are formed on all length scales @xcite . \n the divergent length scale of singlet formation would appear to destabilize the winding number form in eq . \n [ winding ] as expected at criticality . \n to further support the claim that the topological phase transition is in the same universality class as the rs phase we numerically confirmed ( see supporting material ) that the critical scaling of the entanglement entropy contains the @xmath122 correction factor to the central charge as expected @xcite . increasing the disorder beyond the critical point dimerizes the system on the odd bonds , which thus leads to the trivial state .    in conclusion \n we have given a complete picture of the physics of the disordered aiii class in 1d . \n we have given a real - space formula for the aiii winding number in all odd dimensions , shown that topological invariants can be carried by localized states , and that , because of this , the levitation and annihilation topological phase transition is replaced by the random singlet transition for the aiii class in 1d . \n it will be exciting to see if these type of effects can be seen in higher dimensions .",

hand notations @xmath41 and @xmath42  @xcite are used here and in the following . \n the corresponding r.m.s . \n radii are shown in parentheses . \n we see that the overall structure of the form factor is not very much affected by artificially changing the radius of the hoyle state , i.e. for instance the position of the minimum is only changed in very slight proportions . \n however , we can see that the amplitude decreases as the r.m.s radius of the @xmath0 state increases . in order to see how \n sensitively the height of the first maximum depends on the r.m.s . \n radius of the @xmath0 state , we plot on fig . \n [ fig:3 ] the variation of this height with respect to the size of the hoyle state and we see that this height changes strongly when the r.m.s radius of the @xmath0 state is changed . it is therefore allowed to say that the measurement of the inelastic form factor of @xmath43-particle condensate states allows via our model wave function to deduce the radius of such a state . \n we should note that the wave function of the @xmath0 state @xmath44 can be described rather well by @xmath45 as far as reasonable @xmath39 values are adopted . \n the squared overlap between @xmath44 and @xmath45 amounts to @xmath46% at @xmath47 . due to this \n almost complete equivalence between both wave functions , @xmath44 and @xmath36 , we understand that the corresponding inelastic form factors obtained by using both wave functions , i.e. denoted by hw and @xmath48 in fig . \n [ fig:2 ] , almost completely agree with one another . \n as for the other choices of @xmath39 , @xmath45 also has a reasonably large amount of squared overlap with @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath49% , @xmath50% , and @xmath51% at @xmath52 fm , 3.76 fm , and 5.27 fm , respectively . \n it should be emphasized that the fact that the wave function @xmath45 which is parametrized by @xmath38 is more or less a good approximation of the @xmath0 state guarantees the validity of the above discussion of size dependence . \n we can analyze the reason for these features of the form factor in the following simple way . in fig . \n [ fig:3a ] we show the transition density @xmath53 for different values of @xmath38 . due to the orthogonality between @xmath54 and @xmath55 one has the relation @xmath56 . \n we note that the position of the node of @xmath53 at @xmath57 fm and the point where this transition density drops approximately to zero , i.e. at @xmath58 fm , do not depend on the various values of @xmath38 . \n also the feature of an approximate odd function around the nodal point holds for all @xmath38-values . \n it clearly can be concluded that one can approximately write @xmath59 where @xmath60 is independent of @xmath61 and a decreasing function of @xmath38 , whereas @xmath62 is independent of @xmath38 . \n this means that the form factor @xmath63 just changes amplitude but not shape when the size of the hoyle state is varied . \n this analysis is completely consistent with the features seen in fig . \n [ fig:2 ] .    ) multiplied by @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath53 , corresponding to wave functions @xmath65 with different @xmath66 values . \n @xmath48 is given by @xmath67 )  @xcite . \n the r.m.s . \n radii corresponding to @xmath68 are shown in parentheses . \n units of all numbers are in fm.,width=302,height=264 ]    on these grounds we also want to make a prediction of the inelastic form factor to the @xmath43-condensate state in @xmath5o . in fig . \n [ fig:4 ] we show this form factor calculated with the @xmath43-particle condensate wave function for @xmath5o determined previously  @xcite . \n this latter state is actually the @xmath24rd @xmath69 state of our calculation whose energy is at @xmath70 mev . \n we see that the inelastic form factor for @xmath5o resembles very much in its structure the one of @xmath1c . \n the positions of minimum and maximum are almost unchanged , while the height of the first maximum is relatively suppressed compared to the case of @xmath1c . \n a candidate of the @xmath6 condensate state may have been observed at @xmath71 mev with an alpha decay width of @xmath72 mev  @xcite . \n this new state is the @xmath73th @xmath69 state experimentally , corresponding to the @xmath24rd @xmath69 state of our calculation . \n an argument that in @xmath5o the @xmath43-condensate state is around @xmath71 mev could go as follows : it is well known that the second @xmath69 state in @xmath5o at @xmath74 mev has a structure of an @xmath43-particle orbiting in an @xmath75-wave around an @xmath1c - core  @xcite . \n exciting this @xmath1c - core to the hoyle state we find the excitation energy @xmath76 mev . \n of course , this close agreement may be a pure coincidence and more experimental evidences are needed \n .    the experimental determination of the corresponding form factor would be highly welcome and an eventual agreement with our calculated result , we think , a clear indication of the dilute @xmath43-particle structure of the corresponding @xmath69 state in @xmath5o .    in conclusion , we showed that , without adjustable parameters , our proposed condensate wave function for alpha particles  @xcite nicely reproduces the experimental inelastic form factor @xmath77 in @xmath1c . together with its high sensitivity on the magnitude of the hoyle state with respect to its size and the reproduction of other experimental data  @xcite \n , we believe that the almost ideal bose condensate nature of the hoyle state is now firmly established . we also made predictions for the inelastic form factor to the @xmath3 state in @xmath1c which we interpreted in @xcite as a quadrupole particle - hole excitation of the hoyle state . \n a prediction of the form factor @xmath78 condensate state in @xmath5o is also presented and it is argued that an experimental confirmation of this form factor undoubtedly would reveal the condensate character of the corresponding state .",

    "it is argued that radiative decays of scalars @xmath0 can serve as a decisive tool in establishing the nature of the latter . in particular \n , predictions for the widths of the radiative decays @xmath1 ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) are given in the framework of the molecule model of the scalars . \n finite \n range corrections are discussed in detail for the two - gamma decays of hadronic molecules , with a special attention payed to the interplay of various scales involved in the problem and to the gauge invariance of the amplitude . \n the results are applied to the two - photon decay of the @xmath4 , and the existing experimental data on this decay are argued to support the molecule assignment for the scalar @xmath4 . \n = 11.6pt    the problem of the structure of light scalar mesons is of a fundamental importance for understanding the properties of the entire scalar sector , that is , the sector of states with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , including purely gluonic excitations . \n in particular , the identification of the @xmath5 and @xmath4 mesons , together with the experimental studies of the lightest scalars ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , will allow one to establish the structure of multiplets of scalars and to find the signature of the scalar glueball in the spectrum of physical states . \n there are several models for the @xmath5 and @xmath4 . \n the latter can be considered as @xmath8 quark  antiquark states @xcite strongly coupled to the mesonic continuum and thus strongly distorted with the unitarisation process . however , due to the proximity of the @xmath9 threshold , it is natural to assume a considerable admixture of the four  quark component in the wave functions of these mesons , either as a compact four  quark with hidden strangeness @xcite , or as a @xmath9 molecule . \n these might be t - channel exchanges to be responsible for the formation of such a molecule @xcite . \n it is therefore important to establish a test which would allow one to distinguish between these models and thus to reveal the actual nature of these scalars ( in particular , efficient methods to discriminate between the molecule and compact states are strongly needed  for the recent progress see @xcite ) . since years \n , radiative decays of the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , have been considered as such an experimental tool @xcite . indeed , these decays point to a large @xmath9 component in the scalars wave function @xcite . \n still a number of shortcomings of this approach should be mentioned . \n first of all , the radiative decays of the @xmath12 do not allow one to probe the nonstrange component of the scalars , and the contribution of the quark loops is strongly suppressed as compared to the contribution of the meson loops . \n finally , the phasespace available in the final state of these decays is limited to a large extend . in the meantime \n , another class of radiative decays involving scalars is known  the radiative decays of the scalars themselves : @xmath13 , where the vector in the final state is either massive ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) or massless , that is one deals with a two  photon decay in the latter case . \n whatever model of scalars is used , gauge invariance imposes strong constraints on the decay amplitude : @xmath16,\\quad a=\\frac{m^2_v}{m^2},\\quad b=\\frac{m^2_s}{m^2 } , \\label{w1}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the kaon mass and @xmath18 are the four  momenta of the vector particles . \n below we shall evaluate the widths of the radiative decays involving the scalars @xmath0 in the molecule assignment for the latter .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     notice that another approach to two  photon decays of molecules is known in the literature , namely the approach based on the formula @xmath19 which is written in analogy with that for the positronium two  photon decay . \n although this approach appears quite successful in qed , it has to fail in hadronic physics . \n first of all , the w.f . of the kaon molecule is simply not known , so one has to rely on models . \n moreover , since @xmath20 is very sensitive to the details of the bound \n state formation , the predictions of this approach may vary drastically ( the predictions found in the literature vary by an order of magnitude , from 0.6 kev in @xcite to 6 kev in @xcite ) . \n furthermore , any attempt to evaluate corrections to this leading term results in either gauge invariance or energy conservation law breaking . \n indeed , the decay amplitude in this approach is usually given as an overlap integral between the molecule w.f . \n and the amplitude of the process @xmath21 : @xmath22 . \n \\label{m1}\\ ] ] if the amplitude @xmath23 is taken off - shell , then it obviously fails to be gauge  invariant . on the contrary , for the on  shell gauge \n invariant amplitude @xmath23 , kaons carry the energy @xmath24 , rather than @xmath25 , so that energy conservation law is violated . \n the last , but not the least , argument against using the @xmath20-based approach to hadronic processes is that the hierarchy of scales has to be different , namely @xmath26 , in order to validate the given formula with @xmath20 .    finally , we estimate the finite  range corrections to the point - like predictions quoted in tab.[t1 ]  we are interested in the potentially large corrections of order @xmath27 . if the vector in the final state is massive , then the photon in the final state is soft ( @xmath28 ) , and the kinematics of the loop becomes nonrelativistic @xcite . \n inclusion of the finite - range effects amounts to the substitution @xmath29 , with a suitable form of the vertex @xmath30 . \n gauge invariance requires then that the extra momentum dependence coming from the vertex argument should be gauged , that is @xmath31 and the derivative term gives rise to an extra contact diagram with the photon emission from the scalar vertex . \n gauge invariance is therefore preserved to order @xmath32 . \n notice however that one should be extremely careful when treating the loop integrals entering the decay amplitude . \n indeed , although the full amplitude is finite , every individual integral is divergent . \n if a cut - off is introduced then to make them finite , gauge invariance may be badly broken and , as a result , wrong conclusions may be deduced ( see , for example , @xcite and explanations in @xcite ) . \n finally one arrives at the conclusion that no corrections of order @xmath27 appear for the point - like predictions @xcite . the same conclusion holds for the two  photon decays of scalars , though it is not straightforward to arrive at this conclusion and one needs to develop a selfconsistent gauge - invariant approach to this decay . \n it was suggested in @xcite to use an effective kaon interaction lagrangian ( for the neutral - particle exchange , generalisation to the charged - particle exchange being trivial ) written to order @xmath33 : @xmath34 ^ 2 , \\label{lint}\\ ] ] with the coupling constants @xmath35 being of the same order of magnitude . \n this lagrangian is subject to renormalisation to order @xmath33  see @xcite for the details . in the renormalised theory , the kaon propagator and the photon \n emission vertex , which are the dressed quantities , built as solutions of the corresponding field theoretical equations , read : @xmath36 where the ellipsis denotes terms which do not contribute to the decays under consideration . \n the renormalisation constants for the kaon propagator and for the photon emission vertex coincide due to gauge invariance . \n the kaon mass @xmath17 is the renormalised physical mass . \n finally , the most important ingredient  the scalar vertex beyond the point - like limit  comes as a solution of the homogenious bethe \n salpeter equation @xcite : @xmath37 this vertex is to be normalised @xcite , which gives for the scalar coupling the formula @xmath38 which coincides with the point - like result ( [ gs0 ] ) as @xmath39 . with the scalar vertex , the dressed kaon propagator , and the dressed photon emission vertex in hand we are in a position to evaluate the width of the scalar two - photon decay up to the order @xmath33 . \n the amplitude of the process is given by the set of diagrams formally coinciding with those for the point - like vertex , depicted at fig.[3d ] . \n notice , however , an important difference : all ingredients are dressed now , and this is a necessary condition to preserve gauge invariance beyond the point - like limit . \n the only quantity which should not be dressed is the @xmath40 vertex in the third diagram . \n indeed , the scalar vertex @xmath41 obeys the bethe \n salpeter equation and thus absorbs all dressing diagrams .    in view of the fact that we deal with an explicitly gauge  invariant amplitude \n , we use the trick suggested in @xcite and , in order to extract the amplitude , we read - off the coefficient at the structure @xmath42 in the transition matrix element @xmath43 \\epsilon_{1\\mu}^*\\epsilon_{2\\nu}^*,\\quad p = q_1+q_2 , \\label{vertex}\\ ] ] which is a particular case of ( [ w1 ] ) adapted for the two  photon case . then @xmath44 and , by an explicit calculation \n , one can find that @xmath45 . \n therefore , no large corrections of order @xmath27 appear for the point - like result ( [ beauty ] ) . \n we conclude therefore , that finite  range effects give only moderate corrections to the point - like predictions ( of order @xmath46 in the amplitude ) , provided they are included in a self - consistent and gauge - invariant way @xcite . \n we refer to the point - like results presented in tab.1 as to the molecule model predictions for the radiative decays involving scalars . for the sake of comparison \n , we quote in tab.[t1 ] the results of calculations in the quark  antiquark assignment for the scalars , which can be obtained with the help of the results of @xcite . from tab.1 one \n can conclude that experimental data are well described in the molecule assignment for the scalars ( a recent result by belle @xcite @xmath47 kev gives an even better coincidence with the point - like prediction ) . \n furthermore , predictions for the radiative decays of scalars with massive vectors in the final state demonstrate a clear hierarchy , depending on the assignment prescribed to the scalar mesons . \n this makes these decays an extremely promising tool in establishing the nature of the @xmath0 .",

    "organisms shape their own environment , which in turn affects their survival . \n this feedback becomes especially important for communities containing a large number of species ; however , few existing approaches allow studying this regime , except in simulations . here \n , we use methods of statistical physics to analytically solve a classic ecological model of resource competition introduced by macarthur in 1969 . \n we show that the non - intuitive phenomenology of highly diverse ecosystems includes a phase where the environment constructed by the community becomes fully decoupled from the outside world .    understanding the diversity of life forms on our planet is an age - old question . \n recent technological advances uncovered that most habitats harbor hundreds of coexisting `` species '' ( most of which are microbial  @xcite ) , and the problem of understanding such communities is currently at the forefront of medical and environmental sciences  @xcite . \n one of the key obstacles arises from the fact that ecological and evolutionary time scales are generally not separable , giving rise to a coupled `` eco - evolutionary dynamics ''  @xcite . \n the fitness of an organism depends on its environment , but this environment is not fixed : it includes all other organisms in the community , is shaped by their activity and changes on an ecological time scale . understanding this feedback \n has long been recognized as an important question of community ecology  @xcite . \n a convenient example of such ecological feedback appears in models of resource competition  @xcite . \n the survival of an organism is determined by the availability of resources in its immediate environment . in quantitative theories of evolution ( population genetics ) , we typically think of this environment as being fixed externally , but in an ecological setting an experimentalist can only set the conditions faced by the community as a whole , e.g.  the overall influx of resources . \n the immediate environment of an individual is affected by the activity of all other organisms and is not under our direct control . \n for example , consider increasing the overall influx of maltose ( a sugar ) to a multi - species bacterial culture . \n this could lead to an increase of maltose in the medium , opening the community to invasion by a species that grows well on this sugar . \n alternatively , this could enable existing maltose - consuming species to expand in population , driving maltose availability back to the same level , or perhaps even depleting it further . \n the relation between the resources supplied to the community and the immediate environment seen by individual organisms is non - trivial . \n our control extends on the former , but organism survival and therefore community structure are determined by the latter . \n the mechanisms by which organisms shape their environment ( niche construction theory  @xcite ) have been the subject of much research , both at equilibrium ( e.g.  resource competition models  @xcite ) and out of equilibrium ( e.g.  in the study of ecological successions  @xcite ) . \n perhaps the most progress was achieved in the problem of resource competition in a well - mixed community at equilibrium , introduced 50 years ago by macarthur  @xcite . \n however , the geometric approach developed by tilman in his classic work  @xcite allowed him to analyze only the cases with @xmath0 and @xmath1 resources . \n it is not clear to what extent the intuition derived from low - dimensional models applies to the high - dimensional case . \n recently , a simulation - based study of a modestly larger number of resources ( @xmath2 ) exhibited a surprising effect whereby a community interacting with another community would exhibit an effective `` cohesion '' even in the absence of any cooperative interactions between its members , purely as a consequence of environmental feedback  @xcite . \n the number of metabolites at play in a complex microbial community in nature is even larger , of order @xmath3  @xcite . \n it is an intriguing possibility that the phenomenology of high - diversity communities could contain qualitatively novel , non - intuitive regimes . \n however , few existing approaches allow studying niche construction or eco - evolutionary dynamics for a large number of interacting species , except in simulations .    in this work \n , we show that macarthur s classic model of resource competition can be formulated as a problem of statistical physics of a disordered system , and solved analytically in the limit of large @xmath4 . \n we observe a phase transition between two qualitatively distinct regimes . in one regime , \n changes of external conditions propagate to the immediate environment experienced by organisms , as expected . \n however , in the other regime , the immediate environment of individuals organisms becomes a collective property of the community , unaffected by the outside world . \n this regime , which only arises at sufficient diversity , documents the emergence of a collective behavior as a consequence of large dimensionality .    in defining our model \n , we follow ref . \n @xcite , but allow for more generality . \n consider a multi - species community in a well - mixed habitat where a single limiting element @xmath5 exists in @xmath4 forms ( `` resources '' @xmath6 ) . \n for example , this could be carbon - limited growth of bacteria in a medium supplied with @xmath4 sugars . \n let @xmath7 denote the population size of species @xmath8 . \n briefly , the availability @xmath9 of each resource @xmath10 in the immediate environment of individuals will determine the dynamics of @xmath7 . \n the changes in species abundance will translate into changes in the total demand for resources , denoted @xmath11 . \n this total demand , in turn , will determine the resource availability @xmath9 . \n this feedback loop is the focus of our analysis . \n a species is characterized by its requirement @xmath12 for the limiting element @xmath5 , and the `` metabolic strategy '' @xmath13 it employs to try and meet this requirement . \n we think of @xmath14 as the investment of species @xmath15 into harvesting resource @xmath10 ( e.g. , the expression level of the corresponding metabolic pathway ) . \n specifically , for given resource availability @xmath16 , the population growth rate of species @xmath15 is determined by the _ resource surplus _ \n @xmath17 experienced by its individuals : @xmath18 the first term is the total harvest of @xmath5 from all sources , and the second is the requirement an individual must meet to survive . \n the proportionality coefficient is not important , since we will only be concerned with the equilibrium state where @xmath19 . \n species abundances @xmath7 determine the total resource demand @xmath20 . \n this demand shapes resource availability @xmath9 . in the simplest model  @xcite \n , organisms could be sharing a fixed total influx of resource @xmath21 : @xmath22 . in his original formulation , \n macarthur considered a more complex scenario of dynamical resources with renewal rate @xmath23 and maximal availability @xmath24 ; this would correspond to setting @xmath25 see eq . \n ( 3 ) in ref .  @xcite . in the interest of generality \n , here we will say only that the availability of resource @xmath10 is a decreasing function of this total demand : @xmath26 , and allow the functions @xmath27 to remain arbitrary , and possibly different for each resource .    . \n * a : *  if resource availability @xmath28 lies above the line @xmath29 , the species @xmath15 will multiply , depleting resources ( arrow ) . \n * b : *

highlighted ) of the `` unsustainable region '' @xmath31 ; one or two species may coexist.[fig : geom ] ]    this model admits a convenient geometric formulation , where we can think of the metabolic strategies @xmath13 as @xmath32 vectors in the @xmath4-dimensional space of resource availability . \n each hyperplane @xmath33 separates this space into two regions ( fig . \n [ fig : geom]a ) . above this hyperplane \n , a positive resource surplus allows species @xmath15 to multiply . below this hyperplane ( shaded ) , resources are insufficient to support species @xmath15 . \n the intersection of such regions over all competing strategies @xmath34 defines the `` unsustainable region '' @xmath31 : @xmath35 if resource availability @xmath28 is inside @xmath31 , no species can harvest enough resources to sustain its population . \n outside @xmath31 , at least one species can increase its abundance . \n therefore , the equilibrium state can only be located at the boundary of @xmath31 , which we denote @xmath36 . \n the dynamics   possesses a lyapunov function , which is convex and bounded from above , similar to the classic model of macarthur of which this is a generalization ( see si ) . as a result , the equilibrium state always exists , is unique and stable , and can be found by solving a convex optimization problem over the region @xmath37 . at this equilibrium , \n each species is either extinct and can not invade ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , or is present and its resource balance is met ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) . \n fig . \n [ fig : geom]b shows an example at @xmath1 . here , a community of two specialists @xmath42 and @xmath43 , both with cost @xmath44 , is exposed to a mixed strategy @xmath45 with a cost slightly below @xmath44 . \n the species @xmath46 will be able to invade , and depending on resource supply , may coexist with one of the specialists ( but not both ) . \n the equilibrium will harbor one or two species , corresponding to the equilibrium @xmath28 being located either at an edge or at a vertex of @xmath36 . \n the resource depletion rules @xmath27 describe the external conditions : how much of each resource is supplied to the community as a whole . \n in contrast , @xmath28 describes the availability of resources in the immediate environment of individuals , which ultimately dictates which species survive . \n any set of competing strategies @xmath47 defines a unique community equilibrium , and so implements a mapping from external conditions into the actual environment @xmath28 . \n our aim is to characterize the properties of this mapping . \n the geometric intuition described above was first developed by tilman  @xcite , who exhaustively analyzed the cases @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in higher dimensions , however , the enumeration of co - existence regimes for a given set of strategies , like in fig . \n [ fig : geom]b , quickly becomes a combinatorially difficult problem . in this work \n , we therefore adopt the statistical physics approach , and characterize the expected properties of a _ typical _ community , when the competing strategies are drawn out of some ensemble . \n specifically , for each species @xmath15 , we first pick its strategy as a random binary vector , where each component @xmath48 is 1 with probability @xmath49 , and 0 otherwise . \n the parameter @xmath49 allows us to specify the location of a typical competitor on the specialist - generalist axis . \n we then draw a random cost @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a parameter ( the cost scatter , assumed small ) , and @xmath52 is a gaussian random variable of zero mean and unit variance . \n we set the total number of species to @xmath53 . \n the key simplification that makes the problem tractable analytically is the independence of @xmath54 and @xmath52 : the strategy and its cost are effectively uncorrelated . \n this assumption is strong , but far from unreasonable . \n the species competing for the same resources in real communities differ in evolutionary history , lifestyle , and physiology . modeling the cumulative effect of these differences as a random contribution to the species likelihood to succeed \n is arguably a better null model than claiming that the single factor we explicitly consider ( the species metabolic preference ) plays the dominant role in determining its intrinsic performance . \n note that setting @xmath55 satisfies the resource balance of all species within a quantity of order @xmath51 , so this cost model ensures that neither specialists not generalists have an obvious advantage  @xcite . to characterize the fluctuations of resource availability @xmath56 \n , we introduce : @xmath57 the resource surplus of a typical species is given by : @xmath58 \\right\\rangle = -pm\\ ] ] ( the angular brackets denote the mean over @xmath15 ) . \n negative for most species , @xmath17 should hit zero for the lucky outliers who survive . \n we find that the spread of resource surplus values is given by @xmath59 ( see si ) . \n intuitively , this is because species differ in cost ( variance @xmath60 ) , and their strategy ( @xmath13 with variance @xmath61 ) picks out resources with different availability ( variance @xmath62 ) . for this reason , rather than using @xmath62 and @xmath63 directly , for our order parameters we choose @xmath64 and the ratio @xmath65 . \n each particular set of competitors constitutes `` frozen disorder '' , and the properties of a typical community can be computed using methods of statistical physics of disordered systems  @xcite , as detailed in the si . for simplicity , all the results will be quoted for the simplest supply model @xmath66 where each resource is characterized by a single parameter : its total supply @xmath21 ( see si for the general case ) . \n our calculation yields explicit equations for the order parameters @xmath64 and @xmath67 at equilibrium , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath68 at @xmath69 held constant : @xmath70=\\epsilon^2+p(1-p){{\\overline{\\delta r^2}}}\\big[1-\\alpha e(\\lambda)\\big]^2 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath71 is the variance of resource supply @xmath21 , and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are auxiliary functions that can be expressed in terms of the error function @xmath74 .    to study these equations , consider first the limit @xmath75 . in this limit , the parameter space separates into two phases ( fig . \n [ fig : phases]a ) . \n one of these corresponds to the solution @xmath76 and will be called the s - phase ; the other has @xmath77 and will be called the v - phase . \n the critical line ( dotted line in fig . \n [ fig : phases]a ) is described by : @xmath78 for @xmath79 the transition occurs at @xmath80 , consistent with the perceptron phase transition  @xcite .    . \n in the @xmath81-phase , above a critical @xmath69 ( dotted line ) , the fluctuations of internal resource availability @xmath64 vanish , shown here on log scale to highlight the transition . * b. * the distribution of resource surplus at equilibrium . \n black , the theoretical prediction ; red , simulation data accumulated over 500 realizations at

. \n dotted line at critical @xmath69 ; shading labels the two phases.[fig : phases ] ]    to understand the physical meaning of these phases , consider first a community consisting of @xmath4 perfect specialists with costs @xmath85 . \n this community constitutes an example of the s - phase , where the immediate environment of individuals is fully `` * * s**hielded '' from external conditions : faced with an uneven resource supply , species abundance will adjust to drive resource availability to @xmath55 for all @xmath10 , restoring symmetry . \n in general , a restricted set of species ( small @xmath69 ) or a strongly heterogeneous resource supply ( large @xmath71 ) will prevent the community from exactly matching demand to the uneven supply , and the externally imposed asymmetry between resources will propagate into the organisms actual environment @xmath28 ( the v - phase , `` * * v**ulnerable '' to external perturbations ) . \n however , as the community is exposed to new species ( @xmath69 is increased above the critical value ; the arrow in fig . \n [ fig : phases]a ) , the community transitions into the shielded phase where the environment @xmath28 is fully symmetric ( @xmath86 ) and insensitive to external conditions .    to confirm this interpretation , \n consider the number of coexisting species at equilibrium . \n as we have seen , geometrically , this number is the co - dimension ( @xmath4 minus the dimension ) of the region of @xmath36 where the equilibrium is located . \n remarkably , this elusive quantity can also be computed analytically . \n specifically , one can compute the distribution of the resource surplus @xmath87 of all @xmath88 species at equilibrium ( fig . \n [ fig : phases]b ; see si ) : @xmath89 here @xmath90 is the heaviside function constraining @xmath87 to be negative . \n the delta - shaped peak at @xmath91 represents the fraction of species whose resource demand is met . \n the number of survivors is therefore @xmath92 , in excellent agreement with simulations ( fig . \n [ fig : phases]c ) . the s - phase where @xmath93 therefore harbors a complete set of exactly @xmath4 species . \n if the perturbation of external conditions is small , no species will go extinct . \n since the vectors @xmath9 and @xmath12 ( @xmath15 running over @xmath4 surviving species ) are related by a full - rank matrix @xmath14 , this means that the resource availability at the new equilibrium will remain exactly the same , confirming our interpretation of this `` shielded '' phase .    , the phase transition is replaced by a crossover . \n theoretical curves are overlaid with simulation datapoints for a range of @xmath69 ( 10 instances each ) . at large @xmath69 , we observe @xmath94 , confirming that the fluctuations of @xmath9 become negligible . * \n b. * the qualitative distinction between phases persists at finite @xmath51 . here \n , simulation results are shown for @xmath95 . \n a community faces a bimodal supply of @xmath82 resources ( upper panel ) . \n lower panel shows the equilibrium availability of resources @xmath9 ( mean @xmath96 1 standard deviation over 500 instances ) , for two values of @xmath69 corresponding to different phases ( highlighted in panel a ) . in the `` shielded '' s - phase , the asymmetry of the external supply does not affect resource availability @xmath9.[fig : cross ] ]    for a non - zero @xmath51 , the strict phase transition is replaced by a crossover ( fig . \n [ fig : cross]a ) . \n the role of @xmath51 in our model is to measure how strongly a species fate is influenced by intrinsic , rather than environment - dependent ( ecological ) factors  @xcite . for large @xmath51 , community structure is no longer shaped by interactions between community members , but becomes dominated by species who outperform others in all circumstances , and the environmental feedback studied here becomes irrelevant . for small @xmath51 , however , the distinct features of the `` shielded '' and `` vulnerable '' phases remain clearly recognizable : the fluctuations of resource availability are , respectively , of order @xmath51 or much larger than @xmath51 ( fig .  [ \n fig : cross]b ) . \n this result has intriguing implications . \n consider a community facing the strongly uneven resource supply shown in fig . \n [ fig : cross]b ( top panel ) . \n define a species individual performance as its growth rate when placed in this environment , with no other organisms present . \n one might expect this performance metric to be predictive of species survival in a community setting : surely , increasing the supply of maltose to a community should favor organisms that grow well on maltose . in the more intuitive v - phase \n , this expectation is indeed correct . \n however , in the s - phase the internal environment becomes a collective property governed by the statistical properties of the species pool , rather than by the external conditions ( fig . \n [ fig : cross]b ; bottom panel ) . as a result , \n the performance measured in external conditions becomes irrelevant : it no longer predicts whether a species will survive ( fig . \n [ fig : sxxphases ] ) .    in ecological terms , the model considered here was purely competitive : increasing the abundance of any species reduces the growth rates of everyone else , i.e.  there are no `` cooperative interactions '' . \n nevertheless , we have shown that at high dimension , the parameter space of this classic resource competition model contains a strongly collective regime . \n these conclusions were drawn in the context of a particular , highly simplified model . \n in particular , our analysis ignored spatial structure , assumed deterministic dynamics , and considered the equilibrium states only . \n it is clear that natural communities are never in steady state , and stochasticity and spatial structure are tremendously important in most contexts . \n nevertheless , the goal of this work was to explore specifically the feedback of organisms onto their environment and identify the implications of large dimensionality . for this purpose , the simplified model adopted here \n provides a convenient starting point , and highlights the promise of applying statistical physics to gain analytical insight into the non - intuitive phenomenology of large - dimensional networks  @xcite and highly diverse ecosystems . \n we thank michael p. brenner , carl p. goodrich , alpha lee , emily zakem and david zwicker for helpful discussions , the harvard center of mathematical sciences and applications , and the simons foundation . \n this work was completed at the aspen center for physics , supported by national science foundation grant phy-1066293 . \n 99 s. r. gill , m. pop , r. t. deboy , p. b. eckburg , p. j. turnbaugh , b. s. samuel , j. i. gordon , d. a. relman , c. m. fraser - liggett , and k. e. nelson . \n metagenomic analysis of the human distal gut microbiome . \n science * 312 * , 5778 ( 2006 ) . \n j. g. caporaso , c. l. lauber , w. a. walters , d. berg - lyons , c. a. lozupone , p. j. turnbaugh , n. fierer , and r. knight . \n global patterns of 16s rrna diversity at a depth of millions of sequences per sample . \n pnas * 108 * ( 2011 ) . c. a. lozupone , j. i. stombaugh , j. i. gordon , j. k. jansson , and r. knight . \n diversity , stability and resilience of the human gut microbiota . \n nature * 489 * , 7415 ( 2012 ) . \n human microbiome project consortium . \n structure , function and diversity of the healthy human microbiome . \n nature * 486 * , 7402 ( 2012 ) \n . j. a. gilbert , j. k. jansson , and r. knight . \n the earth microbiome project : successes and aspirations . \n bmc biol * 12 * ( 2014 ) . \n r. g. beiko . \n microbial malaise : how can we classify the microbiome ?

    "we study two - flavor collective neutrino oscillations in the dense - neutrino region above the neutrino sphere in a supernova ( sn ) . \n the angular dependence of the neutrino - neutrino interaction potential causes `` multi -

diagonal terms encode phase information . \n the equations of motion are @xmath11 $ ] , where the hamiltonian is  @xcite @xmath12 @xmath13 being the velocity . in the mass basis , \n the matrix of vacuum oscillation frequencies is @xmath14 . \n the matter effect is represented , in the weak interaction basis , by @xmath15 . \n for antineutrinos the only difference is @xmath16 . \n the effective tau - lepton density @xmath17 arises from radiative corrections  @xcite and can be important in a genuine three - flavor treatment of ordinary  @xcite or collective  @xcite sn neutrino oscillations . for the latter , the influence of @xmath18 can be rather sensitive to deviations from maximal 23-mixing .    the angular factor @xmath19 in eq . \n ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) derives from the current - current nature of the weak - interaction hamiltonian . in an isotropic ensemble it averages to unity , whereas the neutrinos streaming off a sn core are strongly non - isotropic so that different angular modes experience a different strength of the neutrino - neutrino interaction potential \n . one may expect that this effect leads to kinematical decoherence among angular modes and thus to flavor equilibrium  @xcite . in a symmetric ensemble with equal densities of neutrinos and antineutrinos , this is indeed the case . such a system is highly unstable in that an infinitesimal deviation from exact isotropy is enough to trigger an exponential run - away towards flavor equilibrium  @xcite . on the other hand \n , a numerical simulation of the flavor evolution of sn neutrinos revealed that multi - angle effects were small : all angular modes evolved nearly collectively , very similar to an isotropic ensemble  @xcite . \n likewise , in a multi - energy system every energy mode feels a different hamiltonian , yet the evolution is collective , i.e. , multi - energy effects do not lead to kinematical decoherence . \n we have performed a numerical exploration of multi - angle effects in a spherically symmetric system where the neutrinos are emitted from a `` neutrino sphere ''  @xcite . \n we have identified the asymmetry between the @xmath8 and @xmath20 flux as the crucial parameter . \n realistic deleptonization fluxes in sne seem sufficient to suppress multi - angle decoherence . \n therefore , in practice multi - angle effects seem to be a subdominant feature of collective sn transformations .    a better understanding of collective oscillations can be developed in the two - flavor case in terms of the usual flavor polarization vectors @xmath21 to express the matrices @xmath9 . \n the equations of motion are @xmath22 . ignoring the ordinary matter effect , the `` hamiltonian '' is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a unit vector in flavor space in the `` mass direction '' and @xmath25 the vacuum oscillation frequency . in an isotropic situation where the velocity terms average to zero , \n the second term is of the form @xmath26 where the vector @xmath27 is the difference between the total neutrino and antineutrino polarization vectors and @xmath28 the neutrino - neutrino interaction strength . \n the individual @xmath29 all lie in a single plane . in the adiabatic limit \n the polarization vectors follow the hamiltonians so that they also lie in this co - rotating plane . \n this observation explains the collective nature of the multi - energy evolution ( all polarization vectors stay in the same plane that rotates around @xmath30 with a certain frequency @xmath31 ) and explains the spectral splits in that the final @xmath32 in the co - rotating plane are either aligned or anti - aligned with @xmath30  @xcite . \n this picture also illustrates a crucial difference to the symmetric system where initially @xmath33 and the overall evolution is purely pendular  @xcite  there is no co - rotating plane .    in a spherically symmetric situation \n every mode is characterized by its vacuum oscillation frequency @xmath34 and its angle @xmath35 relative to the radial direction , providing @xmath36 as the radial velocity . \n now the individual hamiltonians are @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the flux term of the neutrino ensemble , i.e. , the same as @xmath27 , but every mode weighted with @xmath39 . if all polarization vectors lie in a single plane , then also all @xmath32 are in that plane so that an evolution in a co - rotating plane is self - consistently possible . \n our numerical simulations show that those cases with little kinematical decoherence correspond to the polarization vectors essentially staying in a co - rotating plane with some zenith - angle spread . on the other hand \n , the vectors @xmath24 , @xmath27 and @xmath38 do not have to stay in a single plane and in fact , this appears to be an unstable arrangement . \n kinematical multi - angle decoherence corresponds to strong deviations from this coplanar situation . in a spherically symmetric situation , \n the neutrino - neutrino interaction strength decreases with @xmath40 . in a toy model with an artificially slow decrease of @xmath41 one \n can make the evolution arbitrarily slow and adiabatic . in this case \n multi - angle decoherence appears to be unavoidable . \n it appears that in a realistic sn the collective evolution is slow enough to be essentially adiabatic with regard to the development of a spectral split , but fast enough that the co - planar arrangement of the polarization vectors survives . \n this picture may provide the key to an analytic understanding of the conditions for multi - angle kinematical decoherence . \n the assumption of spherical symmetry of the overall system severely restricts possible solutions . \n the evolution is a one - dimensional problem along the radial direction . \n it remains to be studied if this symmetry has an important impact on kinematical decoherence , i.e. , if a system with fewer symmetries would decohere more easily . \n this work was partly supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( tr-27 `` neutrinos and beyond '' ) , by the cluster of excellence `` origin and structure of the universe '' ( garching and munich ) , by the european union ( contracts no.rii3-ct-2004-506222 and mrtn -

dimensional , ill - described , and uncertain systems , which are more and more common in engineered systems design and analysis of `` big data '' measurements . \n this overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems , based on the `` dynamics of observables '' picture . \n we present an overview of several approaches to studying dynamical systems using the koopman operator , which holds promise to resolve these issues . \n the dynamics are analyzed by looking at evolutions of functions on the state space , rather than directly at state space trajectories . \n the evolution can be understood by expanding the function into a basis of eigenfunctions of the koopman operator . \n the first approach is based on the koopman modes , which generalize linear mode analysis from linear systems to nonlinear systems , while preserving global nonlinear features of the system , unlike , e.g. , linearizations based on taylor- and fourier- expansions . \n the second approach identifies coherent structures in flows . \n an equivalence relation between points in the state space can be defined using spectral properties of the koopman operator , where equivalent points correspond to initial conditions that behave statistically the same with respect to any observable . \n the third approach we present introduces continuous quantifications of ergodicity and mixing , concepts existing in ergodic theory that are traditionally treated as binary notions . throughout the paper , \n we highlight examples from the literature using each of these concepts . \n examples are taken from diverse areas such as fluid mechanics , fluid mixing , energy efficiency of buildings , power systems , and unmanned aerial vehicle path - planning for search - and - rescue . \n a common trait of all the methods is that they do not require access to an analytical model of the system ; the spectral properties of the koopman operator can be constructed from measured or simulated data . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _",
    "the idea of defining a gravitational singularity as an obstruction to the dynamical evolution of a test field ( described by a pde ) rather than the dynamical evolution of a particle ( described by a geodesics ) is explored . in particular , the concept of field regularity is introduced which serves to describe the well - posedness of the local initial value problem for a given field . in particular this is applied to ( classical ) scalar fields in the class of curve integrable spacetimes to show that the classical singularities do not interrupt the well - posedness of the wave equation .",
    "gzk photons \" are produced by extragalactic nucleons through the resonant photoproduction of pions . \n we present the expected range of the gzk photon fraction of uhecr , assuming a particular uhecr spectrum and primary nucleons , and compare it with the minimal photon fraction predicted by top -

photon fraction in uhecr . \n we found ( see the pink bands in fig . \n [ f1 ] ) that the gzk photon fraction of the total integrated uhecr flux , for the agasa spectrum is between 5% and 7% above @xmath0 ev and between 30% and 60% above @xmath8 ev , thus auger should be able to see these photons or place interesting bounds on the flux parameters . \n recall that fitting the agasa data with astrophysical sources requires the extreme choices for the initial spectrum mentioned above . with the hires spectrum , instead \n the predicted gzk photon fraction is between 0.01% and 1% of the uhecr above @xmath0 ev and between 0.001% and 4% above @xmath8 ev , thus these photons may or may not be within the reach of auger .     for ( a ) the agasa spectrum ( left panel ) and ( b ) the hires spectrum ( right panel ) . \n the pink regions show the range of gzk photon fractions expected if only nucleons are produced at the sources . \n the curves labeled zb ( z -

down models , proposed as an alternative to acceleration models to explain the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays . \n all top - down models predict photon dominance at the highest energies ( and no heavy nuclei ) . in ref . \n @xcite , we estimated the minimum photon fraction top - down models predict , not only assuming the agasa spectrum , which these models were originally proposed to explain , but also assuming the hires spectrum . \n we showed that at high energy , close to 10@xmath12  ev , the maximum expected flux of gzk photons is comparable to ( for the agasa spectrum ) or much smaller than ( for the hires spectrum ) the minimum flux of photons predicted by top - down models which fit the agasa or the hires data ( see fig . \n [ f1 ] ) . \n three top - down models were considered : z - bursts  @xcite , topological defects ( necklaces ) ( for a review see for example ref . \n @xcite ) and super heavy dark matter particles  @xcite ( in particular , predictions of ref .  @xcite were used ) .    in order to estimate the minimum photon ratio predicted by top - down models we assumed that these models explain only the highest energy uhecr ( if they do not explain even those events , the models are irrelevant for uhecr ) . for this purpose we made liberal use of a component of extragalactic nucleons which would explain all but the highest energy uhecr . \n the assumption of two components , one of accelerated nucleons and another of top - down generated particles , which would conspire to produce a continuous spectrum , is contrived , and was used only as a means to minimize the number of top - down photons . fitting the agasa and hires uhecr spectra in this manner we showed that the photon ratio at energies close to @xmath8 ev is always larger than 10% , in most cases \n is larger than 50% , independently of the uhecr spectrum assumed , making this is a crucial test for top - down models . reaching the level of @xmath1530% ( 10% ) on the photon ratio at energies close to @xmath8 ev \n , auger will find uhecr photons or reject most ( all ) top - down models , independently of the uhecr spectrum .",

    "nuclear spin imaging at the atomic level is essential for the understanding of fundamental biological phenomena and for applications such as drug discovery . \n the advent of novel nano - scale sensors has given hope of achieving the long - standing goal of single - protein , high spatial - resolution structure determination in their natural environment and ambient conditions . \n in particular , quantum sensors based on the spin - dependent photoluminescence of nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) centers in diamond have recently been used to detect nanoscale ensembles of external nuclear spins . \n while nv sensitivity is approaching single - spin levels , extracting relevant information from a very complex structure is a further challenge , since it requires not only the ability to sense the magnetic field of an isolated nuclear spin , but also to achieve atomic - scale spatial resolution . \n here we propose a method that , by exploiting the coupling of the nv center to an intrinsic quantum memory associated with the nitrogen nuclear spin , can reach a tenfold improvement in spatial resolution , down to atomic scales . \n the spatial resolution enhancement is achieved through coherent control of the sensor spin , which creates a dynamic frequency filter selecting only a few nuclear spins at a time . \n we propose and analyze a protocol that would allow not only sensing individual spins in a complex biomolecule , but also unraveling couplings among them , thus elucidating local characteristics of the molecule structure . \n proteins are the most important building blocks of life . \n the ability to obtain high - resolution protein structures is the keystone of drug discovery , since structure naturally reveals binding sites that can be targeted by drugs . \n several methods exist for determining high resolution protein structure , primarily x - ray crystallography  @xcite , transmission electron microscopy  @xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )  @xcite . \n while each method has greatly contributed to our understanding of protein structure , none of them can sense individual molecules . \n of particular interest would be imaging of small active sites of a protein in its natural environment and conditions . \n recently , novel quantum sensors associated with the nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond  @xcite have shown the potential to provide few nt@xmath0 sensing and nanoscale resolution at ambient conditions . \n nv - based magnetometers  @xcite can be transformative tools in quantum information , material science and bio - imaging  @xcite , allowing for example high - resolution magnetic imaging of living cells  @xcite . \n nv centers in bulk diamond have mapped the location of single @xmath1c nuclear spins inside the diamond crystal  @xcite , while shallow - implanted nvs have recently demonstrated the ability to sense a small number of nuclear spins in various organic materials  @xcite , as well as single and small ensembles of electronic spins outside the diamond sensor  @xcite . \n each nuclear spin in samples of interest creates a magnetic field that depends on its position relative to the nv center . for spins 2 - 5 nm away from the nv \n spin , this magnetic field is within range of the sensitivity of the nv quantum probe  @xcite ( see fig .  [ \n fig : nv - antenna].a ) , can be made possible by the long coherence time achieved by careful material preparation  @xcite and by using pulsed  @xcite or continuous  @xcite dynamical decoupling ( dd ) sequences , which can extend the sensing time to hundreds of microseconds . \n the decoupling cancels low - frequency dephasing noise , but by appropriately selecting the control timing to match the nuclear spin larmor frequency , the nv spin can sense the magnetic field created by the nuclear spins , even in the absence of a net nuclear polarization ( spin noise ) . for sparse nuclear spin ensembles , such as encountered in natural diamond , \n this effect is enough to distinguish individual spins and thus to reconstruct their position  @xcite . for dense samples , \n the frequency resolution is inadequate to distinguish individual spins . \n in addition , the intrinsic nmr linewidth in a dense molecule might exceed the nv sensing linewidth .    in the following \n we describe a method to improve the frequency , hence spatial , resolution of nv sensing . \n we evaluate the method performance with simulations on typical bio - molecules and discuss the experimental resources needed to achieve atomic - scale reconstruction of nuclear spin positions . \n c  ( spheres with color scale given by @xmath2 ) is in the range of nt , within reach of nv sensitivity . in the inset : the binding site of interest ( atoms other than @xmath1c  are blue ( o ) and red ( n ) ) . \n ( b ) a shallow nv center ( 2 nm from the surface ) creates a magnetic field gradient ( @xmath3 ) above the [ 111 ] surface of the diamond . note the azimuthal symmetry of the field , which causes degeneracy of the frequency shift at many spatial locations . \n [ fig : nv - antenna],scaledwidth=45.0% ]      we assume that the biomolecule to be probed is attached to the surface of a diamond at the location of a single nv center that is within 3 nm of the diamond surface ( fig . \n [ fig : nv - antenna ] ) . to achieve enhanced spatial resolution for nv sensing of the nuclear spins within the biomolecule \n , we use three critical ingredients : ( i ) an effective strong magnetic field gradient across the biomolecule due , e.g. , to the rapid spatial variation of the magnetic dipolar field from the nv electronic spin ; ( ii ) hamiltonian engineering of the nv and multi - nuclear spin system  @xcite  which creates a very sharp dynamical frequency filter for nv sensing and controls the effect of nv spin polarization leakage through the coupled nuclear spin network ; and ( iii ) a quantum memory  the _ nuclear _ @xmath4n spin associated with the nv center  which enables long acquisition times and hence an even sharper frequency filter .    the sensing protocol works by following the leakage of polarization from the nv center ( which is optically polarized ) toward on - resonance nuclear spins . \n the resonance condition is in principle different for each nuclear spin , as it is given by its position - dependent coupling to the nv center . \n however , simply implementing cross - polarization does not yield enough frequency resolution for single - spin sensing . by alternating periods of cross - polarization with evolution under a magnetic field gradient while the nv spin state \n is preserved by mapping onto the quantum memory the interaction hamiltonian is modulated and only couplings of the nv to resonant nuclear spins are retained . \n evolution under the gradient thus acts as a sharp frequency filter , thereby increasing the spatial selectivity . \n the gradient evolution time can be long , limited only by the quantum memory ( the _ nuclear _ @xmath4n spin associated with the nv center ) coherence time , which at a few milliseconds translates to a high frequency resolution , @xmath5hz .    using the nv polarization leakage as a signature of the nuclear spin position provides two advantages over measurement of nv frequency shifts due to specific nuclear spins . \n first , it is easy to embed nuclear decoupling sequences within the sensing protocol ; nuclear decoupling is essential to narrow the nmr spectrum intrinsic linewidth and thus detect signal arising from individual nuclear spins . \n second , once the polarization is transferred to a nuclear spin , this spin itself becomes a sensitive probe of its local environment . in the following \n we propose a three - step protocol for nuclear spin imaging . in a first step , \n we observe polarization transfer from the nv center to one ( or a few ) nuclear spin(s ) , providing partial information about their positions . \n the nuclear spins can then evolve freely , and polarization diffuses in the nuclear spin network . \n the polarization is then transferred back to the nv center , revealing the nuclear spin connectivity . \n we can thus acquire multi - dimensional spectra that not only decrease frequency crowding , but can also resolve degeneracies related to the intrinsic symmetry of the dipolar coupling . \n next we describe in detail the proposed method and its application to biomolecule structure reconstruction .",

    "density matrix renormalization group methods are used to investigate the quantum phase diagram of a one - dimensional half - filled ionic peierls - hubbard model at the antiadiabatic limit where quantum phonon fluctuations are taken into account partially . \n we found that two continuous phase transitions always exist from dimerized spin - gapped ( bond - order - wave ) state to band - insulator and undimerized spin - gapless ( mott - insulator ) phase while undimerized spin - gapless phase vanishes at the adiabatic limit . \n our results indicate that quantum phonon fluctuations , electron - electron interaction and ionic potential combine in the formation of the bond - order wave phase . \n psfig.sty    2    the response of correlated electrons to lattice distortions in solids has been extensively studied over the years , due to its important role in several classes of materials including high-@xmath0 cuprates , colossal magnetoresistance manganites , conducting polymers and organic charge - transfer salts . as a good example , the peierls - hubbard model , with on - site coulomb repulsion and lattice displacement , is a simple yet nontrivial model that exhibits a rich ground state phase diagram . \n strong correlations lead to the separation of charge and spin excitations @xcite while quantum phonon fluctuations can destroy an ordered gapped state @xcite . \n taking them both into consideration is essential for a full understanding of the nature of these materials .    with the inclusion of additional terms to the peierls - hubbard hamiltonian on different physics background , \n various one - dimensional correlated electronic models were actively studied recently such as the ionic peierls - hubbard model @xcite which is defined as follows @xmath1 b_{l , l+1}+\\delta ~\\sum_{l\\sigma } ( -1)^ln_{l\\sigma }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + u\\sum_l\\left ( n_{l\\uparrow } -\\frac 12\\right ) \\left ( n_{l\\downarrow } -% \n \\frac 12\\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac 12k\\sum_l\\left ( u_l - u_{l+1}\\right ) ^2+\\frac 1{2m}\\sum_lp_l^2 , \\label{iph}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the number operator at site @xmath3 , @xmath4 is electrostatic potential of cations , and anions in charge - transfer salts , @xmath5 is the displacement ( momentum ) of the site @xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the constant for the electron - phonon coupling and lattice elasticity , @xmath8 is the mass and the bond - charge density operator @xmath9 is @xmath10 here we only considered half - filled case .    at @xmath11 , model ( [ iph ] ) can be solved exactly at the adiabatic limit . in appendix \n a , we give the detail process and discuss the definitions of the quantities we used below . \n only one phase transition can be found from dimerized state which is also called bond - order - wave ( bow ) state to band - insulator ( bi ) phase as a function of electron - phonon ( e - p ) coupling strength . at @xmath12 , it is well - known that no phase transition will occur even when @xmath13 goes to infinity as long as there exists e - p coupling at the adiabatic limit . at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , \n earlier work @xcite and recent work @xcite which studied the e - p interaction only in the adiabatic limit also concluded that only one phase transition , i.e. , from the bow to the bi phase , will be present . in other words , the ionic phase with one electron per site is always dimerized . \n therefore , the phase diagram of this model at the adiabatic limit is obvious . \n only two phases , i.e. bow and bi phase , can be detected .    when the lattice distortion is absent , eq . ( [ iph ] ) \n represents the ionic hubbard model ( ihm)@xcite , which was used to describe the neutral - ionic phase transition in mixed - stack charge transfer crystals @xcite . \n as pointed out by fabrizio , gogolin and nersesyan @xcite , there exists an unusual spontaneously dimerized insulator phase , the bow phase , which separates the bi from the mott insulator ( mi ) phase @xcite . \n however , in reality , a lattice distortion always exists and it couples to electronic degrees of freedom strongly in these crystals . \n structure changes , such as volume contraction could be used as an external parameter to drive the neutral - ionic transition @xcite . \n photoinduced cooperative phenomena were also observed @xcite . \n so an important issue to address is the effect of electron - phonon interactions on the phase diagram . \n however , it is well known that results obtained at the adiabatic limit are unreliable . for the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) \n model , fradkin and hirsch @xcite pointed out that the low - energy behavior of the system is actually governed by the antiadiabatic limit @xmath16 , rather than the adiabatic limit @xmath17 . \n the system at any non - zero frequency is renormalized to the limit of infinite frequency . for the holstein model @xcite and the spin - peierls model @xcite \n , more sophisticated calculations showed that uniform gapless phase exists unless the e - p coupling is sufficiently large . on the other hand , \n the system is found always in the dimerized gapped state at the adiabatic limit . \n therefore , in order to study the effect of e - p interaction truly and understand the whole phase diagram , it is necessary to investigate the ground state properties of the system at the antiadiabatic limit .    in the present work \n , we perform an extensive numerical study of eq . \n ( [ iph ] ) at the antiadiabatic limit using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite technique . \n we found that , even with very strong e - p coupling , two continuous phase transitions from bi phase to mi phase are obtained from this model . \n one is the spin transition at @xmath18 where spin excitation gap closed , and the other is the charge transition at @xmath19 where the charge excitation gap vanishes . between these two critical points , \n the system is dimerized . \n in contrast to the adiabatic limit where mi phase vanishes@xcite , this means the ionic phase can also be undimerized after considering quantum phonon fluctuations.our phase diagram is similar to that of ihm@xcite which is still highly controversial over the years@xcite . furthermore , \n in the region of strong ionic potential , the critical values @xmath20 and @xmath21 decrease simultaneously with increasing e - p coupling , while @xmath22 will increase with increasing e - p coupling at sufficiently small ionic potential . \n the ground state phase diagram is obtained with the use of finite - size - scaling analysis .    at the antiadiabatic limit @xmath16 , an effective interacting fermion model @xcite @xmath23 \n can be obtained where the effective bond - charge attraction ( @xmath24 ) term accounts for the contribution of the phonon quantum fluctuations . \n so the hamiltonian ( [ iph - na ] ) could be viewed as a 1d e - p interacting system including both the quantum phonon fluctuations and the electron correlations .    in this paper \n , we have applied the finite - size dmrg algorithm with open boundary conditions to study the hamiltonian ( [ iph - na ] ) at half - filling . \n this method allows us to probe directly correlation functions and structure factors associated with the spin density wave ( sdw ) , the charge density wave ( cdw ) and the bond order wave in the ground state . \n lattices up to @xmath25 sites were frequently used in our studies . \n the largest number of states kept in the calculation was @xmath26 per block . \n the hopping integral @xmath27 is set to @xmath28 as the energy unit . \n the weight of the discarded states was typically about @xmath29 depending on whether the system is in its critical state or not in the final sweep . \n the convergence tests as functions of number of states kept were carefully performed . \n we checked our dmrg calculations against exact numerical results for noninteracting ( @xmath30 ) chains ( up to @xmath25 sites ) and results from exact diagonalization for interacting ( @xmath14 , @xmath31 ) chains ( up to @xmath32 sites ) . \n excellent agreement was found in both cases . when interactions are turned on , \n there exist finite excitation gaps on finite chains , so the accuracies of all quantities we calculated are no worse than that of the noninteracting case . thus , numerical errors in our work could be safely estimated to be smaller than @xmath33 . \n the staggered bow correlation functions of the ionic peierls - hubbard model for @xmath34 and @xmath35 . \n the inset shows an extrapolation of @xmath36 with a third - order polynomial in @xmath37.,width=321 ]    now let s introduce a way to determine the phase boundaries accurately . \n although parts of this method have already been first used in determining the phase boundaries of ihm@xcite , we perform this method more carefully and systematically in this paper than ever by using various finite - size analysis . \n first we defined the staggered bow correlation function which is the most direct evidence for the long - range bow state @xmath38 where @xmath39 . in fig . 1 \n , we show the staggered bow correlation functions with increasing hubbard @xmath13 at @xmath34 and @xmath35 . here \n we only perform the average in eq . \n ( [ cfbow ] ) over 256 sites in the middle of the @xmath25-site system , i.e. the sum over @xmath3 is from @xmath40 to @xmath41 and @xmath42 , in order to further avoid boundary effects . \n @xmath43 is the half of the chain length @xmath44 which is located in the central of the system to further eliminate edge effects . \n the results indicate that there exist three different phases in model ( [ iph - na ] ) since the staggered bow correlation functions show three distinct type of behavior as @xmath45 increases : ( i ) it decays exponentially at @xmath46 , indicating that the system has no bow order ; ( ii ) it converges to a nonzero constant at @xmath47 and @xmath48 , indicating that the system is in the bow phase with a finite width ; ( iii ) it decays as @xmath49 at @xmath50 , indicating that the system is in another phase . \n the bow order parameter in the thermodynamic limit    @xmath51    can be obtained by fitting @xmath36 ( = @xmath52 , where the sum over @xmath45 goes to @xmath43 ) with a third - order polynomial in @xmath37 since @xmath53 for @xmath54 . \n the inset of fig . \n 1 shows such extrapolations . in the following \n we always take @xmath55 which is enough to minimize the oscillations due to the open boundary conditions and sum over @xmath45 is only take over central @xmath43 site where @xmath43 is half of the chain length @xmath44 to further eliminate edge effects . \n we find that @xmath56 approaches zero when @xmath46 and @xmath57 but remains finite when @xmath47 and @xmath48 which indicate that there exists a finite region of the bow phase . \n behavior of @xmath58 across the phase boundary for @xmath59 , @xmath35 . \n the inset shows a linear extrapolation of the critical values @xmath60 and @xmath21 with @xmath37.,width=321 ]    next we have studied the nature of bi - bow and bow - mi transitions by calculating the static structure factors corresponding to different phases to determine the phase boundaries . \n the first structure factor studied is    @xmath61    according to fabrizio et . \n al.@xcite , phase transitions on the bi - bow and bow - mi phase boundaries are an ising type and kt type respectively , the staggered connected correlation function falls off algebraically as    @xmath62     finite - size analysis for @xmath58 and @xmath63 in the vicinity of the first phase transition at @xmath60 for @xmath64 , @xmath65.,width=321 ]    away from phase boundaries , this quantity falls off exponentially . therefore the @xmath66 is expected to diverge at these two critical points if @xmath67 or reach maximums if @xmath68 as the system size goes to infinity . fig . \n 2 shows the results of the @xmath69 for different system sizes with @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath70 . as expected , the @xmath66 peaks twice for all the different system sizes we calculated . \n the positions of these two peaks become closer as the system size is larger . the inset of fig . \n 2 shows linear extrapolations of the positions of these two peaks with @xmath37 . \n we find that these two peaks will not merge at @xmath54 which indicate again that the bow phase remains finite at thermodynamic limit . in order to give more convincing evidence , we did another finite - size analysis in the vicinity of these two phase transitions . \n let us start from the first phase transition at @xmath71 . \n fig . \n 3(a ) presents plots of @xmath72 $ ] versus @xmath73 $ ] for @xmath34 , @xmath35 and three different values of @xmath74 around the first critical point . \n data points for @xmath75 indeed fall on a straight line , indicating critical scaling for the bow fluctuations . at the other two points @xmath76 and @xmath77 , data points behave nonlinearly due to the exponential decay term . applying the same finite - size analysis to the cdw structure factor @xmath78 \n , we can also explore the nature of the first phase transition . \n the cdw structure factor is defined as @xmath79 the linear behavior of @xmath80 $ ] around @xmath81 , shown in fig . \n 3(b ) , confirms the vanishing of the charge gap at the first phase transition point . \n @xmath82 vs @xmath83 for @xmath64 , @xmath35 and 6 different values of @xmath13 across the mi - bow boundary . \n , width=321 ]    next we determine the nature of the second phase transition at @xmath18 . as predicted by fabrizio et . \n al.@xcite , it is a quantum phase transition of the kt type . \n this makes it difficult to determine the phase boundary directly from the behavior of @xmath66 and @xmath84 ( defined below ) due to the finite - size effects . \n instead , we apply an indirect method , used by sengupta et al.@xcite , to confirm the second phase transition . \n the sdw structure factor is defined as    @xmath85    it is well known @xcite that if the ground state of a 1d system is spin - gapless , the spin - spin correlation falls algebraically with exponent equal to @xmath28 . \n it has been further shown@xcite that in the spin - gapless phase @xmath86 as @xmath87 whereas in the spin - gapped phase @xmath88 . \n even a very small spin gap can be detected in this way , since it is in practice sufficient to see the @xmath89 decay below @xmath90 for small @xmath83 to conclude that a spin gap must be present . \n fig . \n 4 shows the behavior of @xmath89 for @xmath34 , @xmath65 and different values of @xmath74 . in the gapless region , \n logarithmic corrections @xcite make it difficult to observe the approach to @xmath28 as @xmath87 . in analogy with spin systems@xcite , we expect the leading logarithmic corrections to vanish at the point where spin gap opens and therefore exactly at the critical point there should be a clear scaling to @xmath28 . based on results shown in fig . \n 4 , we estimate the mi - bow boundary to be at @xmath91 at @xmath34 , @xmath92 which is consistent with the results shown in fig . \n 2 . \n the inset of fig.4 further provides evidence for the transition from the spin - gapped state , as identified by the exponential decay of the staggered sdw correlation function , to the spin -

p coupling @xmath96 . in the weak ionic potential region , such as @xmath101 , on increasing the e - p coupling @xmath96 , the transition points @xmath60 and @xmath21 move apart and the separation between @xmath60 and @xmath21 becomes significantly larger . \n however , for strong ionic potential , such as @xmath102 , both @xmath20 and @xmath21 decrease and the width of the bow phase increases slightly with increasing e - p coupling . when the ionic potential is intermediate , such as @xmath103 , @xmath60 and @xmath21 will also decrease simultaneously while the width of the bow phase increases significantly . for model ( 1 ) at the adiabatic limit , a spin gap will always be present@xcite . however , at the antiadiabatic limit , the transition from bow to mi phase always occurs even though the e - p coupling is sufficiently large . \n the inset of fig . \n 5 shows the asymptotic behavior of the critical points @xmath104 and @xmath21 at @xmath105 and @xmath34 with increasing e - p coupling . for weak on - site potential such as @xmath105 , \n the critical point @xmath21 becomes larger with increasing e - p coupling while for strong on - site potential for example @xmath34 , it decrease monotonously with the increasing e - p coupling . \n however the behavior of @xmath60 is the same for all value of on - site potential , it decreases monotonously as a function of e - p coupling . \n here we only show one set of data at @xmath34 .    in conclusion \n , we have studied 1d half - filled ionic peierls - hubbard model at the antiadiabatic limit using the dmrg method . \n the phase diagram is obtained by investigating correlation functions and structure factors . \n in contrast to the adiabatic limit , the transition from the dimerized spin - gapped state to the spin - gapless state occurs for any value of the ionic potential @xmath4 . compared to the ihm \n , the bow phase always exists in the presence of e - p coupling @xmath96 . \n the first critical value @xmath60 for the charge gap always decreases with increasing @xmath96 while the second critical value @xmath21 for the spin gap shows different behavior for weak and strong ionic potential . \n it is a pleasure to acknowledge helpful discussions with y. j. wang , y. l. liu and p. thalmeier , x. q. wang . \n this work is supported by the research grants council of the hksar , project no . \n cuhk 4037/02p . \n c. q. wu also acknowledges financial support from the national natural science foundation of china ( no . \n 19725414 and no . \n 90103034 ) .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to present a model of a ` quantum space - time ' in which the global symmetries of space - time are unified in a coherent manner with the internal symmetries associated with the state space of quantum - mechanics . \n if we take into account the fact that these distinct families of symmetries should in some sense merge and become essentially indistinguishable in the unified regime , our framework may provide an approximate description of or elementary model for the structure of the universe at early times . \n the quantum elements employed in our characterisation of the geometry of space - time imply that the pseudo - riemannian structure commonly regarded as an essential feature in relativistic theories must be dispensed with . \n nevertheless , the causal structure and the physical kinematics of quantum space - time are shown to persist in a manner that remains highly analogous to the corresponding features of the classical theory . in the case of the simplest conformally flat cosmological models arising in this framework \n , the twistorial description of quantum space - time is shown to be effective in characterising the various physical and geometrical properties of the theory . \n as an example , a sixteen - dimensional analogue of the friedmann - robertson - walker cosmologies is constructed , and its chronological development is analysed in some detail . \n more generally , whenever the dimension of a quantum space - time is an even perfect square , there exists a canonical way of breaking the global quantum space - time symmetry so that a generic point of quantum space - time can be consistently interpreted as a quantum operator taking values in minkowski space . in this scenario , \n the breakdown of the fundamental symmetry of the theory is due to a loss of quantum entanglement between space - time and internal quantum degrees of freedom . \n it is thus possible to show in a certain specific sense that the classical space - time description is an emergent feature arising as a consequence of a quantum averaging over the internal degrees of freedom . \n the familiar probabilistic features of the quantum state , represented by properties of the density matrix , can then be seen as a by - product of the causal structure of quantum space - time . \n address = blackett laboratory , imperial college , london sw7 2bz , uk     address = department of mathematics , king s college london , the strand , london wc2r 2ls , uk",

    "an important class of cryptographic applications of relativistic quantum information work as follows . \n @xmath0 generates a random qudit and supplies it to @xmath1 at point @xmath2 . \n @xmath1 is supposed to transmit it at near light speed @xmath3 to to one of a number of possible pairwise spacelike separated points @xmath4 . \n @xmath1 s transmission is supposed to be secure , in the sense that @xmath0 can not tell in advance which @xmath5 will be chosen . \n this poses significant practical challenges , since secure reliable long - range transmission of quantum data at speeds near to @xmath3 is presently not easy . \n here we propose different techniques to overcome these diffculties . \n we introduce protocols that allow secure long - range implementations even when both parties control only widely separated laboratories of small size . in particular \n we introduce a protocol in which @xmath1 needs send the qudit only over a short distance , and securely transmits classical information ( for instance using a one time pad ) over the remaining distance . \n we further show that by using parallel implementations of the protocols security can be maintained in the presence of moderate amounts of losses and errors . \n @xmath6 correspondence to a.p.a.kent@damtp.cam.ac.uk    [ sec : intro ]    quantum theory and the relativistic no - signalling principle both give ways of controlling information , in the sense that someone who creates information somewhere in space - time can rely on strict limits both on how much information another party can extract and on where they can obtain it . while standard quantum cryptography ( e.g. @xcite ) uses only the properties of quantum information , an increasingly long list of applications \n illustrate the added cryptographic power of the relativistic no - signalling principle , either alone ( e.g. @xcite ) , or when combined with quantum information ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n a new relativistic quantum cryptographic technique was recently introduced , inspired by the no - summoning theorem @xcite , in which one agency ( alice or @xmath1 ) sends a quantum state , supplied by and known to another agency ( bob or @xmath0 ) but unknown to @xmath1 , at light speed @xmath3 in one of a number of possible directions . \n we use the term agency here to stress that alice and bob are not single isolated individuals : they have representatives ( who we assume are all loyal and act according to the instructions of their agency ) distributed at various points in space - time . \n the task is securely implemented if the chosen direction is concealed from @xmath0 until @xmath1 chooses to return the state . \n this gives , inter alia , a provably unconditionally secure protocol for bit commitment @xcite and a way of transferring data at a location unknown to the transferrer @xcite . \n another class of applications arises in scenarios where the unknown state is a quantum authentication token supplied either by @xmath0 or by a third party @xmath7 . \n @xmath1 may wish to use this token , by transferring it to @xmath0 , at a space - time location @xmath8 that she chooses , without giving @xmath0 advance notice of her choice . \n for example , the token here might be a quantum password authenticating access to a site , or quantum money used to execute a trade .    in their simplest forms , \n all these applications require @xmath1 to propagate the quantum state securely from one point @xmath2 to one of a number of points @xmath4 in its causal future , in such a way that @xmath0 can not obtain any advance information about @xmath1 s choice of @xmath8 . \n we first discuss ways of implementing this task of secure unknown state transmission to a hidden location . \n next we consider an extended task where @xmath1 also wants to allow @xmath0 to verify that the state was sent to the chosen @xmath8 , at or after the point @xmath8 . \n if the state was indeed securely transmitted , this can in principle be achieved by returning it to @xmath0 at @xmath8 , where @xmath0 can measure the returned state and test whether it is the state he originally provided . \n as we will see , if the state originally supplied is a pure qudit known to @xmath0 , alice s probability of passing this test at two distinct specified sites is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dimension of the hilbert space . \n we can thus ensure both that @xmath1 s transmission is secure against @xmath0 until the state is returned and that @xmath0 can be near - certain of which point @xmath8 was chosen after the state is returned \n .    however , secure ( or even insecure ) quantum transmission from @xmath2 to the @xmath8 may not always be possible for @xmath1 . even in a future world \n in which reliable long - range quantum transmission technology exists , one can easily imagine scenarios in which @xmath1 ( a user of the infrastructure who has relatively few resources ) does not have such technology , while @xmath0 ( an infrastructure provider with large resources ) does . \n we describe here strategies for such scenarios , in which @xmath1 and @xmath0 exchange classical and quantum information so as to have the same cryptographic effect \n i.e. , @xmath1 chooses one of the @xmath8 , a choice that @xmath0 can verify at or after the relevant @xmath8 but not earlier  without @xmath1 necessarily actually transmitting any unknown states to any of the @xmath8 . \n we also describe a variation which achieves this result even when neither party has reliable long - range quantum transmission . \n furthermore , real life implementations must also allow for losses and errors . here \n we show that relativistic quantum cryptography can be made secure even in the presence of moderate levels of losses and/or errors . \n the results presented here show that there is considerable flexibility in the implementation of relativistic quantum cryptographic protocols . \n this makes the prospect of experimental implementation of such protocols much more realistic , thereby bringing them closer to practical applications . \n we suppose throughout that @xmath0 does in fact carry out the optimal verification measurements on states returned to him . \n the reason for assuming this is to define a quantifiable measure of security against @xmath1 . in practice \n , @xmath0 may actually verify only some , or none , of the returned states in any given run , depending on the ultimate application .",

    "a partial wave analysis ( pwa ) of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems produced in the reaction @xmath2 at 18  gev/@xmath3 was carried out using an _ isobar _ model assumption . \n this analysis is based on 3.0 m @xmath1 events and 2.6 m @xmath0 events and shows production of the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons . \n an earlier analysis of 250k @xmath0 events from the same experiment showed possible evidence for a @xmath7 exotic meson with a mass of 1.6  gev/@xmath8 decaying into @xmath9 . in this analysis of a higher statistics sample of the @xmath10 system in two charged modes we find no evidence of an exotic meson . \n quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts a spectrum of _ hybrid _ mesons beyond the @xmath11 bound states of the conventional quark model in which the gluons binding the quarks manifest their degrees of freedom . \n lattice qcd and qcd - inspired models predict that the gluonic field within the meson forms a flux tube for quark separation greater than 1  fermi @xcite . \n when the flux tube is in its ground state conventional mesons emerge . \n when the flux - tube is in its excited states hybrid mesons emerge . for conventional mesons the spin ( @xmath12 ) , \n parity ( @xmath13 ) and charge conjugation ( @xmath14 ) quantum numbers of the @xmath11 system are those of a fermion  antifermion system : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the angular momentum between the quarks and @xmath17 is the total quark spin ; @xmath18 ; and @xmath19 . thus @xmath20 are not allowed . \n these _ exotic _ quantum numbers are allowed when the quantum numbers of the excited flux - tube are included and are thus a signature for hybrid mesons . \n the fundamental interest in the spectrum and other properties ( decay modes and widths ) of hybrid mesons is that flux tubes are thought to be responsible for the confinement of quarks and gluons in qcd .    in 1998 , \n the e852 collaboration reported evidence for the @xmath21 , a @xmath7 exotic hybrid meson with a mass of 1.6  gev/@xmath8 decaying into @xmath9 . \n the original publication @xcite of this result was followed by another @xcite giving more details of the analysis based on 250,000 events of the reaction @xmath22 at 18  gev/@xmath3 collected in the e852 experiment at brookhaven lab in 1994 . a search for this state by the ves collaboration in the reaction @xmath23 interactions at 37 \n gev/@xmath3 @xcite did not confirm this state . \n the partial wave analysis ( pwa ) procedure used to extract these results was based on the _ isobar _ model assumption whereby the final state @xmath24 system is reached via an intermediate state of a di - pion resonance ( _ e.g. _ @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) and a bachelor @xmath30 . \n this paper reports on the analysis of additional data collected in 1995 including 3.0 m events of the reaction @xmath31 and 2.6 m events of the reaction @xmath22 . \n we compare the isobar model pwa of these two large data sets with each other and with the analysis presented in @xcite . \n the comparison of the two @xmath10 modes provides powerful cross checks . \n any resonance decaying to @xmath32 should decay equally to @xmath33 and @xmath34 and thus appear with equal probabilities in the two modes . \n similarly , any resonance decay to @xmath35 ought to appear twice as often in @xmath36 as @xmath37 . \n and these same isospin rules dictate relationships between the two modes for all other decay sequences . \n since the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes rely on different elements of the detector , any misunderstandings in the acceptance would affect the two modes differently and inconsistencies would result . as the results will show , this is not the case . \n the data reported on in this paper were collected in the e852 experiment at the alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) at brookhaven laboratory ( bnl ) using the multi - particle spectrometer ( mps ) augmented with a forward electromagnetic calorimeter ( lgd ) consisting of 3000  lead glass blocks . \n an 18.3  gev/@xmath3 @xmath38 beam was incident on a liquid hydrogen target . \n details about the e852 experiment are given elsewhere @xcite . \n the 1995 run of e852 collected approximately 146 m ( 265 m ) triggers requiring one ( three ) forward going charged particles . for those triggers requiring only one forward track \n , it was also required that the trigger processor @xcite detected an energy deposition pattern in the lgd consistent with an effective mass greater than a single @xmath39 . \n the kinematic fitting program squaw @xcite was used in identifying approximately 73 m ( 79 m ) reconstructed events that were consistent with the topology @xmath40 . this constrained fit used the measured track and beam momenta , the measurements from the lgd and constraints on the recoil particle mass ( @xmath41 ) and di - photon effective masses ( two pairs @xmath42 ) to refine the measured final state particle 4-momenta . in the @xmath43 topology , 13.8 m events survived this selection while 16.8 m events of the @xmath44 topology survived . \n further cuts on fit confidence level , vertex position and correlation between the @xmath45 system and a recoil track produced the final data set analyzed here : 3,025,980 @xmath43events and 2,585,852 @xmath44events . \n figures  [ fig1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the acceptance uncorrected @xmath1 and @xmath46 effective mass distributions respectively . \n enhancements in the @xmath47 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 mass regions are observed . the acceptance in @xmath45 effective mass is also shown in figures  [ fig1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) . \n dalitz plots for the @xmath1 and @xmath46 systems in the @xmath5 mass region are shown in figures  [ fig1 ] ( c ) and ( d ) respectively . \n these dalitz plots clearly show rich structure and bands corresponding to decays into @xmath48 and @xmath49 , motivating application of the isobar model . \n the pwa software used in this analysis consisted of programs developed at bnl and indiana university ( iu ) @xcite . \n the formalism is similar to that used in @xcite but the details of handling the data and doing the the pwa fits differ . \n the iu software was optimized for running on a 200-processor computer cluster ( avidd ) @xcite allowing systematic studies involving many pwa fits , varying isobar parameters and using different wave sets . \n results from the two programs were compared with each other and found to be consistent . \n the iu programs were also used to analyze the data presented in @xcite and produced consistent results . \n the analysis is performed in the gottfried - jackson frame . within the isobar formalism \n each partial wave is characterized by @xmath50 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the spin , parity and charge conjugation of the @xmath45 system , respectively , @xmath51 is the spin projection along the @xmath52 axis and @xmath53 represents symmetry of the @xmath45 system under reflection in the production plane . \n finally @xmath54 is the spin of the isobar and @xmath55 is the relative orbital angular momentum between the isobar and the bachelor @xmath30 . except for the @xmath56 wave \n , all @xmath57 resonances are parametrized using relativistic breit - wigner functions with blatt - weisskopf factors .    following @xcite a sufficient set of partial waves \n was determined by sequentially removing waves from a parent set containing waves with @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 and examining the resulting change in likelihood . \n if no significant change in likelihood was obtained , the wave was removed . \n the exotic @xmath61 partial waves were kept even though they would have been chosen for removal by the above criteria  the existence of signals in these waves is discussed below . based on these criteria \n the compiled set includes 35 waves and a background wave we refer to this as the _ high wave _ set . in comparison , \n the wave set used in the analysis described in @xcite included 20 waves and a background wave  we refer to this as the _ low wave _ set . \n the 35 wave set included three additional @xmath62 , seven additional @xmath63 and seven additional @xmath64 waves this high wave set did not include two negative reflectivity partial waves ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) that were included in the low wave set pwa . \n another arbiter of wave set sufficiency is the comparison of moments , @xmath67 , of the @xmath68 functions as calculated directly from the data and as calculated using the results of pwa fits . \n we define @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents the euler angles of the @xmath45 system @xcite and the intensity @xmath71 is determined directly from experiment or computed using the results of the pwa fits . in figure  [ fig2 ] \n we show the h(201 ) and h(420 ) moment comparisons as a function of @xmath45 mass for the @xmath72 channel for low wave and high wave set pwa fits . \n we also show the difference between data and pwa calculations of the moments as @xmath73 ( summing differences squared divided by errors squared summed over all mass bins and divided by the number of mass bins ) for various moments . \n similar plots are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] for the @xmath46 channel . \n the moments calculated using the pwa results from the high wave set have better agreement with experimental moments . \n but there are moments ( such as h(201 ) - shown in part ( a ) of figure  [ fig3 ] ) for which agreement is not achieved and this is most likely due to the inherent inadequacy of the isobar model in describing the underlying production mechanism . \n figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show the pwa fit results for the @xmath72 and @xmath74 channels respectively as a function of the @xmath45 effective mass . in part(a ) of each figure the sum of the waves is shown along with the background wave . \n the background wave is added incoherently with the other waves and is isotropic in all decay angles . \n the fitting procedure constrains the sum of all waves to describe the observed @xmath45 effective mass . \n parts ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of each figure show the mass dependence of the @xmath75 and @xmath76 waves and their phase difference . results are shown for both the low wave and high wave set . to within 10% \n the acceptance corrected yields of @xmath77 in the two @xmath45 modes are equal , consistent with expected decays into @xmath78 and @xmath79 . and the yield for @xmath80 is higher by a factor of two for the @xmath81 modes when @xmath82 compared to @xmath83 , consistent with expectations from isospin . \n the @xmath84 and @xmath85 waves and their phase difference are consistent with two interfering breit - wigner line shapes . for the @xmath85 wave in the @xmath74 channel ( figure  [ fig5](c ) ) \n we also show the published @xmath85 wave from the pwa of diffractive @xmath45 production in @xmath86 interactions at 63 and 94  gev/@xmath3 from the accmor collaboration @xcite . \n the @xmath87 wave and its interference with the @xmath84 wave are shown in parts ( e ) and ( f ) of each figure . when the low wave set is used in the fit \n , an enhancement is observed for the exotic @xmath61 wave in the @xmath45 mass region around 1.6  gev/@xmath8 , consistent with the observation of @xcite  _ \n i.e. _ we obtain the same results when we use the same wave set . \n but the enhancement disappears when the high wave set is used . \n this effect is observed for both @xmath45 channels . and \n the phase ( see part ( d ) ) of the exotic wave relative to the dominant @xmath84 wave is similar for both wave sets and dominated by the phase of the @xmath4 . \n the amplitudes of the negative reflectivity exotic waves show the same behavior , disappearing as the fit improves . \n the masses and widths of the @xmath88 and the @xmath28 were varied and the maximum likelihood was achieved using current best values for these quantities @xcite . \n different parameterizations of the @xmath89 s - wave were also examined @xcite . while small changes in the likelihood were observed , no systematic changes in the pwa results occurred . \n the pwa results presented here were for data with @xmath90  ( gev/@xmath3)@xmath91 where @xmath92 is the square of the momentum transferred from the incoming @xmath38 to the outgoing @xmath10 system . \n pwa fits were also carried out for 12 other regions in @xmath92 and the results are similar to those presented here .    in summary , there is no evidence for an exotic @xmath7 meson in the @xmath45 system and in particular for the @xmath21 .",

plane magnetic field is used to tune the spin frequency gap splitting across the single - mode cavity resonance at 7.75 ghz , where clear anticrossings are observed with a splitting as large as @xmath8 mhz at @xmath7 k. the spin - cavity collective coupling rate is shown to scale as the square root of the number of active spins in the ensemble .    thanks to pioneering experiments and theoretical proposals , \n quantum technologies have enormously advanced and the interest can now be turned to explore viable routes for practical applications . \n several pure quantum systems , including cold atoms , photons , superconducting qubits , spin impurities in si , or nitrogen vacancies ( nv ) in diamond - among many others - have been deeply investigated in the last decade as potential candidate qubits for applications in quantum information processing , and techniques for their read out and manipulation have been developed.@xcite advantages and limitations of each system have been debated : whilst large margins of improvement are still possible for the different techniques , fundamental limits are clear for each system . \n a possible strategy to overcome these barriers is to combine quantum systems of different nature and take advantage of the best features of each of them in hybrid quantum devices . \n of course , this opens new technological challenges . along these lines , \n high - quality factor resonators play a pivotal role , since photons can be coupled with a number of other two - level systems ( qubits ) while begin optimal flying quantum bits themselves . among them , planar resonators are particularly suitable to be coupled with a variety of atomic or solid state qubits , with the final goal of developing an on - chip hybrid quantum technology.@xcite in fact , mm - length microwave resonators can be routinely fabricated in a scalable arrangement and on different substrates . \n in particular , state - of - art superconducting resonators allow the achievement of power - independent quality factors as high as @xmath9 or above in planar geometry at the single photon level.@xcite     k and @xmath10 . \n the input power is @xmath11 dbm . \n the red line shows the calculated curve . \n temperature dependence of the ( b ) resonance frequency , @xmath12 , and ( c ) loaded quality factor , @xmath2 . in the inset ( d ) \n a sketch of the ybco coplanar resonator is shown.,width=321 ]    a key step to coherently transfer information between cavity photons and stationary qubits is to achieve the strong coupling regime : electric or magnetic dipole coupling between the qubit and the confined electromagnetic field should overcome their respective damping rates.@xcite electric dipole coupling allowed the observation of the strong coupling with single quantum emitters.@xcite on the other hand , spin ensembles collectively coupled to microwave resonators have been proposed for a hybrid quantum technology.@xcite since the magnetic dipole coupling of a single spin to a resonator mode , @xmath13 , is typically too small , a collective enhancement of the effective coupling rate of @xmath14 spins @xcite , scaling as @xmath15 , allows to overcome the limitations due to both the decoherence rate of the spin system , @xmath16 and the inverse photon lifetime in the cavity , @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the resonant frequency and @xmath19 is the resonator quality factor).@xcite in this way , collective strong coupling of spin ensembles and microwave photons has been experimentally shown in coplanar resonators,@xcite three - dimensional ( 3d ) cavities,@xcite and microwave oscillators.@xcite while 3d resonators are less suited for on - chip integration , all of the previous achievements employing planar resonators were obtained with conventional superconductors ( typically nb ) , which are limited to operate at moderate magnetic fields . however , manipulation of spins may need application of finite magnetic fields.@xcite microwave resonators made of high @xmath20 superconductors , such as ybco , have shown excellent performances from liquid nitrogen temperatures @xcite down to mk range and single - photon regime.@xcite thanks to the large value of their intrinsic upper critical field , these systems offer unprecedented possibilities for spin manipulation .    in this letter \n , we show that ybco coplanar resonators have excellent performances under strong magnetic fields , with quality factors significantly exceeding @xmath21 up to @xmath22 k. therefore , they appear as a significant step ahead for quantum technology applications . \n stimulated by recent theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite results , here we focused on the high photon number and high temperature regimes , where we report the strong collective coupling of an electron spin ensemble to ybco microwave coplanar resonators . \n our major interest is to use molecular spins , which offer several advantages with respect to spin impurities.@xcite interesting and sufficiently long phase memory times have been reported for simple radicals,@xcite mono - metallic cu phthalocyanine molecules,@xcite or ( pph@xmath23)@xmath24[cu(mnt)@xmath24 ] derivatives.@xcite in the present work , we employed commercial di(phenyl)-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)iminoazanium ( dpph ) , which is regularly used as field calibration marker in epr spectroscopy . \n the decoherence time of dpph is @xmath26 ns,@xcite while the continuous wave linewidth is sharp ( @xmath27 mhz)@xcite due to the exchange narrowing effect . \n below 10 k the linewidth increases as an effect of antiferromagnetic interactions [ @xmath28 mhz at 2 k].@xcite the strong coupling between dpph radicals and a confined microwave field has been already demonstrated with 3d cavities@xcite or microwave oscillators.@xcite    superconducting resonators were fabricated by optical lithography upon wet etching ( 2% h@xmath29po@xmath23 solution ) of commercial 10 x 10 mm@xmath30 double sided yba@xmath24cu@xmath29o@xmath31 ( ybco , in short ) films ( 330 nm thick ) on sapphire ( 430 @xmath32 m ) substrates ( ceraco gmbh ) . \n the film is gold - coated on the back side to improve the contact to ground . the patterned coplanar structure is constituted by a 8 mm central strip having width \n @xmath33 @xmath32 m and separation @xmath34 @xmath32 m from the lateral ground planes [ fig . \n [ fig1 ] ( d)].@xcite the coupling of the resonator to the feed line can be adjusted by finely tuning the position of the launchers . \n we tested five ybco planar resonators finding quite reproducible results.@xcite low temperature measurements were performed using a quantum design ppms cryo - magnetic system equipped with 7 t magnetic field applied parallel to the plane of the resonator . \n reflection [ @xmath35 and transmission [ @xmath36 scattering parameters were measured by means of an agilent pna vector network analyzer ( vna ) .    , and ( c ) the loaded quality factor , @xmath2 , on the externally applied magnetic field , @xmath1.,width=321 ] \n we first show that coplanar resonators made of ybco allow expanding temperature , magnetic field , and power ranges with respect to the nb cavities commonly used in circuit -

100 k. to extract @xmath12 and @xmath2 we fitted each spectrum with eq . \n [ lorentzian ] . \n figure  [ fig1](b ) shows a small shift of @xmath12 between 2 and 60 k. for higher temperature the resonance peak shifts towards lower frequencies , and it disappears in correspondence to the ybco film critical temperature ( @xmath46 k ) . \n the loaded quality factor [ fig . \n [ fig1](c ) ] progressively decreases with increasing @xmath0 , while remaining @xmath47 for @xmath48 k. this behavior is in line with similar results reported in the literature.@xcite    an applied magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) generally gives rise both to a decrease of the quality factor and to a hysteretic behavior of the resonant frequency . while this behavior was effectively observed for intermediate temperatures,@xcite at low temperature the field dependence becomes progressively weaker . \n figure  [ fig2](a ) shows a series of @xmath45 spectra measured at 2 k for increasing @xmath1 , up to 7 t. the values of @xmath12 and @xmath2 extracted from eq . \n [ lorentzian ] are plotted as a function of @xmath1 in ( b ) and ( c ) : they are remarkably stable up to 7 t , being @xmath49 . \n we notice that for nb resonators a drop of @xmath2 is observed for fields in the mt range.@xcite degradation of the quality factor of the superconducting resonators against the applied field is due to the dissipation mechanisms related to the vortex motion . \n this effect has been generally described in terms of increase of the surface resistivity ( @xmath50 ) under applied magnetic field , whilst recent experimental results have evidenced that more sophisticated models are required for thin films.@xcite surface resistivity measurements performed at 20 k by means of the dielectric resonator method have shown a weak dependence of @xmath50 with respect to a dc field up to 5 t applied parallel to the ybco film.@xcite these findings , independently obtained by different experimental techniques , corroborate the field dependence of @xmath2 we report in fig . \n [ fig2 ] .    summarizing the results of the ybco resonators characterization , \n the decay rate of the cavity remains reasonably smaller than @xmath51 mhz in a wide temperature and magnetic field ranges , and we can therefore exploit these unique properties to perform circuit - qed experiments with spin ensembles as follows . \n a thin layer of dpph powder was attached to the center of the ybco resonator by means of silicone grease . \n the volume of the sample ( @xmath52 mm@xmath53 ) was estimated under optical microscope , and it corresponds to a total number of approximately @xmath54 radicals.@xcite in fig . \n [ fig3 ] we report the evolution of the transmission peak in correspondence to the resonance field of the dpph spin ensemble ( @xmath55 t ) . at 2 \n k two branches are observed , which indicate the presence of a large anticrossing between the resonator mode and the spin ensemble [ fig . \n [ fig3](a ) ] . cross - sectional @xmath45 spectra measured on resonance show two peaks separated by @xmath56 mhz [ fig . \n [ fig3](b ) ] . \n the fit of the off - resonance ( 0.2694 t ) spectrum with eq . \n [ lorentzian ] gives @xmath57 ghz , @xmath58 and @xmath59 db . thus , the cavity decay rate results @xmath60 mhz , while the estimated number of photons inside the cavity mode volume@xcite is @xmath61 . \n for increasing temperature , the width of the anticrossing decreases and the splitting is progressively reduced to @xmath62 mhz ( at 5 k ) and @xmath63 mhz ( at 10 k ) [ fig . \n [ fig3](d ) and ( f ) ] . \n the splitting of the transmission peak in correspondence to the resonance field of dpph is observed up to 50 k.@xcite to evaluate the magnitude of the collective coupling constant @xmath64 , we fitted the resonance frequency by using the usual expression for the vacuum field rabi splitting ( neglecting the damping rates , i.e. the imaginary parts of the split eigenfrequencies)@xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the land @xmath69-factor of dpph . \n the fitted rates @xmath70 are plotted as a function of temperature in fig .  [ fig4 ] ( black circles ) , spanning from 39 mhz at 2 k to 9 mhz at 40 k. hence , the strong coupling condition,@xcite @xmath71 , is clearly satisfied in our sample in the whole temperature range up to 40 k.     dbm ) . \n the left column shows a series of two - dimensional maps obtained by plotting @xmath45 for different applied @xmath1 . \n temperature : 2 k ( a ) , 5 k ( c ) and 10 k ( e ) . dashed red lines display the calculated curves . \n the right column shows the cross sections related to the corresponding right panel , either on resonance ( cyan ) or off resonance ( blue).,width=321 ]    to interpret the results in fig . \n [ fig4 ] , we notice that the number of polarized @xmath72 spins ( @xmath73 ) varies with temperature as @xmath74 simultaneously , @xmath64 rescales non - linearly as @xmath75 where @xmath13 is the coupling of a single spin 1/2 to the resonator mode . in fig . \n [ fig4 ] we calculated the behavior of @xmath64 by means of eqs . \n [ tanh ] and [ collective_g ] ( solid red line ) . \n the best fit was obtained by means @xmath76[mhz]@xmath77 . from the zero temperature limit ( @xmath78 ) , and the finite temperature values , we estimated a single - spin coupling rate in a restricted range @xmath79 hz . \n these values well compare with the one independently estimated from the known parameters of our resonators,@xcite besides being consistent with the values reported in the literature for different cavity geometries and spin systems.@xcite we also notice that even at the highest temperatures at which strong coupling can be observed , when only a small fraction of spins is coupled to the microwave mode , the condition @xmath80 still holds , for which eq . \n [ collective_g ] is a safe assumption.@xcite    to get further insight about the @xmath81 dependence , we removed a portion of dpph sample from the resonator and we repeated the measurements to extract the reduced coupling constant @xmath82.@xcite the remaining sample corresponds to approximatively @xmath83 of the original volume . the total number of @xmath72 radicals is thus reduced to @xmath84 and @xmath85 . to compare these results with @xmath86 , in fig . \n [ fig4 ] we plotted the rescaled coupling constant @xmath87 as function of @xmath0 and @xmath88 ( open squares ) . \n the very good agreement between @xmath82 and @xmath86 corroborates the behavior described from eqs . \n [ tanh ] and [ collective_g ] .    in summary \n , we have shown that ybco microwave planar resonators constitute a viable route for the implementation of on - chip quantum technologies . \n in particular , we have shown their robustness against an external magnetic field up to 7 t and up to liquid nitrogen temperature , which makes them ideal candidates for circuit - qed experiments with spin ensembles . to display their potentialities \n , we showed that the collective strong coupling regime of a dpph ensemble coupled to coplanar ybco resonators can be achieved up to 40 k.

the compressibility along the @xmath15 axis is thus significantly ( 64% ) larger than that along the @xmath16 axis . \n the binding within the boron layers is evidently much stronger than between the layers . \n these results are in reasonable agreement with electronic structure calculations by loa and syassen@xcite . \n recent synchrotron x - ray diffraction studies at rt in a diamond - anvil - cell ( dac ) to much higher pressures ( 8 - 12 gpa ) using dense he@xcite or methanol - ethanol@xcite as hydrostatic pressure media yield the bulk moduli @xmath17 gpa and @xmath18 gpa , respectively , in agreement , within experimental error , with the he - gas study@xcite . \n a further dac study@xcite to 7 gpa with silicon oil as pressure medium gives the significantly smaller value @xmath19 gpa , even though the reported 2.9% decrease in unit cell volume upon applying 6.5 gpa pressure is _ less _ than the 4% decrease found in the other two dac studies@xcite . \n the strong deviation of the `` silicon oil '' data@xcite may arise from difficulties in extrapolating the data to zero pressure to obtain the bulk modulus and/or from shear stresses arising from the solidification of the silicon oil under pressure . \n the relatively large compressibility anisotropy in mgb@xmath1 mandates the use of hydrostatic pressure in quantitative studies , since shear stresses applied by non - hydrostatic pressure media to an elastically anisotropic sample can lead to erroneous results . \n several studies of the dependence of @xmath0 on pressure have appeared for mgb@xmath1 .  in the first experiment utilizing a fluid pressure medium ( fluorinert ) , lorenz _ _ \n et al.__@xcite report that @xmath0 decreases linearly with pressure to 1.8 gpa at the rate @xmath20 k / gpa . \n on the other hand , using the same pressure medium , saito _ et al . \n _ @xcite find the more rapid decrease @xmath21 k / gpa . \n both groups cite their results to argue that mgb@xmath1 is a bcs phonon - mediated superconductor@xcite , as is also argued by loa and syassen@xcite .  in further experiments to 25 gpa utilizing the solid pressure medium steatite , monteverde _ _ et al.__@xcite \n find that @xmath0 decreases under pressure at differing initial rates ( -0.35 k / gpa to -0.8 k / gpa ) , @xmath22 showing a quadratic behavior for two of the four samples studied ; each of the four samples was prepared using a different synthesis procedure .    in the present experiment , \n @xmath22 is determined to 0.7 gpa in an ac susceptibility measurement using a he - gas pressure system ; the helium pressure medium remains fluid at @xmath5 39 k up to 0.5 gpa and thus applies true hydrostatic pressure ( no shear stresses ) to the sample . \n we find that @xmath0 decreases linearly and reversibly with pressure at the rate @xmath23 k / gpa . \n implications for the nature of the superconducting state are discussed . \n the powder sample for this study was taken from the same mother sample used in parallel neutron diffraction studies@xcite . \n it is made using isotopically - enriched @xmath7b ( eagle picher , 98.46 atomic % enrichment ) . \n a mixture of @xmath7b powder ( less than 200 mesh particle size ) and chunks of mg metal were reacted for 1.5 hours in a capped bn crucible at 800@xmath24c under an argon atmosphere of 50 bar .  as seen in fig . \n 1 , the resulting sample displays sharp superconducting transitions in the ac susceptibility with full shielding and an onset temperature at ambient pressure @xmath25 39.25 k.  both x - ray and neutron diffraction data show the sample to be single phase with the alb@xmath1-type structure . \n the present high pressure studies were carried out using a he - gas high - pressure system ( harwood ) to 1.4 gpa ; the pressure is determined by a calibrated manganin gauge in the compressor system at ambient temperature . \n the superconducting transition of the 8.12 mg mgb@xmath1 powder sample is measured by the ac susceptibility technique using a miniature primary / secondary coil system located inside the 7 mm i.d . \n bore of the pressure cell .  a small pb sphere with 1.76 mm dia . \n ( 38.58 mg ) is also inserted in the coil system for susceptibility calibration purposes ; for selected data the superconducting transition temperature of this pb sphere serves as an internal manometer@xcite to check the pressure indicated by the manganin gauge .  the cube pressure cell ( unipress ) , which is connected to the compressor system by a 3 mm o.d . \n @xmath26 0.3 mm i.d . \n cube capillary tube , is inserted into a two - stage closed - cycle refrigerator ( leybold ) operating in the temperature range 2 - 320 k.  the pressure can be changed at any temperature above the melting curve @xmath27 of  the helium pressure medium ( for example , @xmath28 13.6 k at 0.1 gpa and @xmath28 38.6 k at 0.50 gpa@xcite ) .  for pressures above 0.5 gpa , @xmath27 lies above @xmath0 ; the slight pressure drop ( few 0.01 gpa s ) on cooling from @xmath27 to @xmath0 is estimated using the isochores of he@xcite . \n all pressures are determined at the temperature @xmath5 39 k.  further details of the experimental techniques are given elsewhere@xcite .    in fig . \n 1 are shown representative examples of the superconducting transition in the ac susceptibility at both ambient and high pressure .  with increasing pressure \n the narrow transition is seen to shift bodily to lower temperatures , allowing a determination of the pressure - induced shift in @xmath0 to within @xmath29 10 mk . \n remarkably , close inspection of the data for 0.50 gpa reveals a slight shift in the transition curve near its midpoint , accurately marking the position of the melting curve of helium ( @xmath28 38.6 k ) at this pressure .    in fig . \n 2 , @xmath0 is plotted versus applied pressure to 0.7 gpa and is seen to follow a highly linear dependence @xmath23 k / gpa . \n the first data point 1@xmath30 was obtained after first applying a pressure of @xmath31 0.7 gpa at rt before cooling down to low temperatures ( @xmath31 60 k ) and reducing the pressure , yielding @xmath5 38.88 k at 0.341 gpa . \n point 2@xmath30 was measured after releasing the pressure at low temperature , giving @xmath5 39.25 k at ambient pressure ( 0 gpa ) ; no change in @xmath0 occurred after intermittently warming the sample to rt ( point 3 ) . \n further data were obtained following pressure changes at both rt ( unprimed data ) and low temperature ( primed data ) .  as is observed for the vast majority of superconducting materials without phase change , \n the dependence of @xmath0 on pressure for mgb@xmath1 is single - valued and does not depend on the pressure / temperature history of the sample ; such history effects do occur in certain high-@xmath0 oxides containing mobile species at rt@xcite . \n we thus find that for he - gas pressure changes at both ambient and low temperature , @xmath22 for mgb@xmath1 is a linear , reversible function of pressure to 0.7 gpa @xcite .    in the present experiments \n the sample is surrounded by fluid helium near @xmath5 39 k for all data taken at pressures @xmath32 gpa so that the slope @xmath33 -1.11 k / gpa gives the true hydrostatic pressure dependence of @xmath0 . \n the fact that the sample is in solid helium for @xmath34 gpa is seen in fig . 2 to have no effect on the pressure dependence @xmath35 indeed , solid helium is the softest solid known . \n our value of @xmath8 differs significantly from those of other groups@xcite ( see discussion above ) using pressure media which are either solid at rt or freeze upon cooling down at temperatures well above @xmath36    in view of the strong compressibility anisotropy@xcite and the sizeable anharmonicity and non - linear electron - phonon coupling@xcite anticipated for mgb@xmath1 , it is likely that shear stresses of sufficient magnitude will cause appreciable changes in the pressure dependence of @xmath37 as observed for other anisotropic substances such as the superconducting oxides@xcite and organic superconductors@xcite . \n the largest shear stresses are generated by changing the pressure on a solid pressure medium , such as steatite , or using no pressure medium at all . \n the shear stresses generated in cooling fluorinert or other comparable liquids through the melting curve are admittedly much smaller and depend on details of the individual experimental procedures used , such as the cooling rate , change in applied force upon cooling , etc . \n only experiment can determine whether or not the @xmath22 dependences measured in the fluorinert experiments@xcite are influenced by shear stresses .  to exclude the possibility of sample - dependent effects , \n such experiments should be carried out on a single sample . \n lorenz _ _ et al.__@xcite have very recently carried out he - gas high - pressure studies on the same sample studied by them previously in fluorinert@xcite and find a value of @xmath8 equal to their previous value ( -1.6 k / gpa ) , within experimental error ; further measurements in the same he - gas system on a second , high - quality sample yielded the dependence @xmath38 k / gpa , a value very close to our present result . \n this finding lends support to the observation by monteverde _ \n et al . \n _ @xcite that @xmath8 in mgb@xmath1 may be sample dependent . \n the present @xmath22 studies and parallel high - pressure structural studies by jorgensen _ _ et al.__@xcite were both carried out on the same mgb@xmath1 sample over the same he - gas pressure range , thus allowing an accurate determination of the change in @xmath0 with lattice parameter .  the change in @xmath0 with unit cell volume , for example , is given by @xmath39 using the above values @xmath23 k / gpa , @xmath40 gpa , and @xmath41 k.    we will now discuss the implications of this result for the nature of the superconducting state in mgb@xmath42  first consider the mcmillan equation@xcite \n @xmath43   /\\left [   \\lambda-\\mu ^{\\ast}(1 + 0.62\\lambda)\\right ]   \\right\\ }   , $ ] valid for strong coupling ( @xmath44 which connects the value of @xmath0 with the electron - phonon coupling parameter @xmath45 an average phonon frequency @xmath46 and the coulomb repulsion @xmath47 which we assume to be pressure independent .  taking the logarithmic volume derivative of @xmath0 , we obtain the simple relation @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the grneisen parameter , @xmath50 is the hopfield parameter@xcite given by the product of the electronic density of states and the average squared electronic matrix element , and @xmath51   /\\left [   \\lambda-\\mu ^{\\ast}(1 + 0.62\\lambda)\\right ]   ^{2}.$ ]    eq . \n ( 2 ) has a simple interpretation . \n the first term on the right , which comes from the prefactor to the exponent in the mcmillan expression for @xmath0 , is usually small relative to the second term , as will be demonstrated below . \n the sign of the logarithmic derivative @xmath52 , therefore , is determined by the relative magnitude of the two terms in the curly brackets . \n the first `` electronic '' derivative is negative ( @xmath53 for simple metals ( s , p electrons ) @xcite , but equals -3 to -4 for transition metals ( d electrons)@xcite ) , whereas the second `` lattice '' term is positive ( typically @xmath54  since in simple - metal superconductors , like al , in , sn , and pb , the lattice term dominates over the electronic term , and  @xmath55 is always positive , the sign of @xmath52 is the same as that in the curly brackets , namely positive ; this accounts for the universal decrease of @xmath0 with pressure due to lattice stiffening in simple metals .  in selected transition metals \n the electronic term may become larger than the lattice term , in which case @xmath0 would be expected to increase with pressure , as observed in experiment@xcite . \n let us now apply eq . \n ( 2 ) in more detail to a canonical bcs simple - metal superconductor . \n @xmath56 in sn , for example , @xmath0 decreases under pressure at the rate @xmath33 -0.482 k / gpa which leads to @xmath57 @xcite .  inserting @xmath25 3.73 k , @xmath58 k @xcite , and @xmath59 into the above mcmillan equation \n , we obtain @xmath60 from which follows that @xmath61  inserting these values into eq . \n ( 2 ) and setting @xmath62 from above for simple metals , we can solve eq . \n ( 2 ) for the grneisen parameter to obtain @xmath63 in reasonable agreement with experiment for sn ( @xmath64@xcite . \n similar results are obtained for other simple - metal superconductors . \n we now repeat the same calculation with the mcmillan equation for mgb@xmath1 using the logarithmically averaged phonon energy from inelastic neutron studies@xcite @xmath65 k , @xmath66 k , and @xmath67 yielding @xmath68 and @xmath69 .  from eq . \n ( 1 ) we have @xmath70  since the pairing electrons in mgb@xmath1 are believed to be s , p in character@xcite , we set @xmath62 @xcite .  inserting these values into eq . \n ( 2 ) , we find @xmath71 in reasonable agreement with the value @xmath72 from raman spectroscopy studies@xcite or @xmath73 from _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations on mgb@xmath1 @xcite .  if , on the other hand , one were to use the same bulk modulus but the pressure derivative @xmath21 k / gpa from saito _ _ et al.__@xcite , one obtains from eq . \n ( 2 ) the unusually high value @xmath74    in extensive specific heat@xcite and high - resolution photoemission studies@xcite on mgb@xmath75 evidence is found for a multicomponent superconducting gap ; the latter study also reports an inconsistency in the values of the electron - phonon coupling constant from mcmillan s equation and the renormalization of the electronic density - of - states . \n these results call into question the suitability of the isotropic mcmillan equation for describing this system .    under the above assumptions , \n we thus conclude that the rate of decrease of @xmath0 with pressure found in the present experiments on mgb@xmath1 is consistent with bcs phonon - mediated superconductivity . \n the authors hope that the accurate determination of the volume dependence of @xmath0 in this work , @xmath4 will stimulate _ ab initio _ theoretical calculations .  at first glance \n the present results appear to be inconsistent with the model of hirsch and marsiglio@xcite which predicts that @xmath0 should increase with pressure for optimally doped samples . \n however , within their model , @xmath0 for a non optimally doped sample may decrease if sufficient change in the carrier concentration occurs when pressure is applied . \n further studies , such as high - pressure hall effect measurements , are necessary to clarify this possibility . \n * acknowledgments *    work at washington university supported by nsf grant dmr 98 - 03820 and that at the argonne national laboratory by the u.s . \n department of energy , office of science , contract no . \n w-31 - 109-eng-38 . \n 99 j. nagamatsu , n. nakagawa , t. muranaka , y. zenitani , and j. akimitsu , nature * 410 * , 63 ( 2001 ) . \n j. g. bednorz and j. a. mller , z. phys . \n b * 64 * , 189 ( 1986 ) . \n s. l. budko , g. lapertot , c. petrovic , c. e. cunningham , n. anderson , p. c. canfield , preprint cond - mat/0101463 ;

    "numerical relativity , applied to collisions of black holes , starts with initial data for black holes already in each other s strong field . \n for the initial data to be astrophysically meaningful , it must approximately represent conditions that evolved from holes originally at large separation . \n the initial hypersurface data typically used for computation is based on mathematically simplifying prescriptions , such as conformal flatness of the 3-geometry and longitudinality of the extrinsic curvature . in the case of head on collisions of equal mass holes \n , there is evidence that such prescriptions work reasonably well , but it is not clear why , or whether this success is more generally valid . here we study these questions by considering the `` particle limit '' for head on collisions of nonspinning holes , i.e. , the limit of an extreme ratio of hole masses . \n the mass of the small hole is considered to be a perturbation of the schwarzschild spacetime of the larger hole , einstein s equations are linearized in this perturbation , and described by a single gauge invariant spacetime function @xmath0 , for each multipole . \n the resulting quadrupole equations have been solved by numerical evolution for collisions starting from various initial separations , and the evolution is studied on a sequence of hypersurfaces . in particular , we extract hypersurface data , that is @xmath0 and its time derivative , on surfaces of constant background schwarzschild time . \n these evolved data can then be compared with `` prescribed '' data , evolved data can be replaced by prescribed data on any hypersurface , and evolved further forward in time , a gauge invariant measure of deviation from conformal flatness can be evaluated , and other comparisons can be made . \n the main findings of this study are : ( i ) for holes of unequal mass the use of prescribed data on late hypersurfaces is not successful . \n ( ii ) the failure is likely due to the inability of the prescribed data to represent the near field of the smaller hole . \n ( iii ) the discrepancy in the extrinsic curvature is more important than in the 3-geometry . \n ( iv ) the use of the more general conformally flat longitudinal data does not notably improve this picture .",

12 photons , arise if the binding energy is small , @xmath24 , while smaller average multiplicities , 4 - 6 photons , occur for large bindings , @xmath21 . in the latter case \n considerable rates extend up to multiplicities of 8 photons .    0.3 cm    we can get an analytic result for small bindings , i.e. large @xmath25 , by obtaining the maximum of the logarithm of eq.([ratio ] ) using sterling s formula ( @xmath26 ) . the maxima are given by the zeros of    @xmath27    which for large @xmath25 has the approximate solution    @xmath28    and implies a multiplicity of @xmath29 . \n present searches of low mass monopoles have been carried out by making use of their magnetic properties trapped in matter , by looking for tracks associated with their ionization properties and by studying two photon decays at colliders @xcite . at colliders like the tevatron or the lhc \n the conservation of magnetic charge implies that either monopolium or a pair monopole - antimonopole could be produced . \n monopolium , being chargeless , is difficult to detect except for its decay properties . \n if monopole - antimonopole are produced close to threshold they might annihilate given their large interaction before reaching the detector . \n in this experimental scenario we might not have been able to detect monopolium and/or monopoles because we have been looking into trapped monopoles , ionization remnants or the two photon channel , which according to our present investigation is most unlikely . \n our analysis shows that a characteristic feature of monopolium decay is many photons arising from the annihilation vertex . at the monopolium threshold \n , these photons will have on average much smaller energy than the energy of a typical collider process . \n the same type of argument applies to monopole - antimonopole annihilation . to conclude we state , that as long as the exact dynamics of monopoles and their properties are unknown , large multiplicity of photon events might be the signal for the discovery of these elusive particles .",

    "whether or not the initial star cluster mass function is established through a universal , galactocentric - distance - independent stochastic process , on the scales of individual galaxies , remains an unsolved problem . \n this debate has recently gained new impetus through the publication of a study that concluded that the maximum cluster mass in a given population is not solely determined by size - of - sample effects . here , we revisit the evidence in favor and against stochastic cluster formation by examining the young ( @xmath0 a few @xmath1 yr - old ) star cluster mass  galactocentric radius relation in m33 , m51 , m83 , and the large magellanic cloud . to eliminate size - of - sample effects , we first adopt radial bin sizes containing constant numbers of clusters , which we use to quantify the radial distribution of the first- to fifth - ranked most massive clusters using ordinary least - squares fitting . \n we supplement this analysis with an application of quantile regression , a binless approach to rank - based regression taking an absolute - value - distance penalty . \n both methods yield , within the @xmath2 to @xmath3 uncertainties , near - zero slopes in the diagnostic plane , largely irrespective of the maximum age or minimum mass imposed on our sample selection , or of the radial bin size adopted . \n we conclude that , at least in our four well - studied sample galaxies , star cluster formation does not necessarily require an environment - dependent cluster formation scenario , which thus supports the notion of stochastic star cluster formation as the dominant star cluster - formation process within a given galaxy .",

    "we report the first observation of ` orbital truncation rods '  the scattering arising from the termination of bulk orbital order at the surface of a crystal . \n the x - ray measurements , performed on a cleaved , single -

induced second order transition . \n an issue destined to be of increasing importance in the science of correlated - electrons systems in the coming years is the question of whether the electronic behaviour , such as charge , orbital or spin order , is different at a surface or interface compared to the bulk of the material . \n this question is of central importance from an applied perspective  any device one fabricates from these materials will require electron transport across an interface ; from a nanoscience perspective  nanoscaled objects are defined by their very large surface - to - volume ratio ; and from a fundamental perspective  understanding the role of reduced dimensionality in determining the electronic behaviour of such systems is a key component in understanding the general problem of strongly correlated electron systems .    in many ways \n manganites represent an ideal system to address the role of the surface , because all the relevant degrees of freedom  charge , spin and orbital  play an active role in determining the ground state . as a result \n , they are exquisitely sensitive to perturbations , and hence , might be expected to exhibit relatively large surface effects . \n in fact , while the vast majority of experimental work has focused on bulk properties@xcite , the very few surface sensitive studies do suggest that the surface of a manganite may be quite different from the bulk . \n for example , the measurements of freeland _ et al._@xcite showed that the top bilayer of a cleaved surface of a ferromagnetic bilayered manganite is magnetically dead , though the second bilayer has full bulk magnetic order . \n similarly , the half - doped single - layer manganite , which is known to exhibit bulk orbital order below @xmath4  k , showed no superlattice reflection corresponding to such ordering down to 80  k , when probed with surface - sensitive leed @xcite . \n thus , there is evidence that the surface of manganite crystals may exhibit different electronic phases than the bulk  a phenomena that has been coined ` electronic reconstruction'@xcite in analogy with more traditional surface science studies of atomic reconstruction driven by surface energetics .    in this paper , we present the first study of orbital order at a surface , utilizing surface x - ray scattering . \n the advantage of using x - ray scattering in this endeavour is that it provides information on both the electronic surface ( specifically , atomic displacements associated with orbital order ) and the chemical surface , separately . \n it is well known that the abrupt truncation of a sample by its surface gives rise to rod - shaped x - ray scattering around the bragg reflections , the so - called crystal truncation rods ( ctr ) . \n the intensity profiles of such rods provide detailed , quantitative information about the chemical surface@xcite . \n similarly then , the abrupt termination of orbital order by a surface should give rise to orbital truncation rods ( otr ) running through the orbital superlattice peaks . \n these would allow one to quantify the surface orbital order . here , we present the first observation of such orbital truncation rod scattering . \n this allows us to quantitatively probe the orbital order in the vicinity of the surface . \n working with a freshly cleaved la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , we show that the orbital order has a significantly rougher interface than the chemical surface and a shorter correlation length than in the bulk . \n these results imply that the surface order parameter is reduced relative to the bulk . \n further , the temperature dependence of the surface orbital order suggests that the surface exhibits a more continuous transition than the bulk ordering transition . taken together \n , these results demonstrate that the surface is a significant perturbation in regard to the electronic phenomena of orbital ordering and point to the need for an improved theoretical understanding of how the surface couples to such electronic orders . \n we first discuss surface preparation and characterization . \n single crystal samples of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , which has the layered perovskite structure shown in fig . \n [ fig : chem_sur ] ( a ) , were grown by the floating zone method . \n the samples were then either cleaved perpendicular to the @xmath5-axis in he and placed in a sealed he -

vector@xcite . \n one of the primary goals of this work was to observe such scattering . to this end , we measured the ( 20@xmath9)@xmath7(@xmath15 ) intensity distribution below @xmath16231  k , the bulk orbital order transition temperature . \n we discuss first transverse scans taken across such ` orbital rods ' ( figure  [ fig : oo -

ctr](a ) shows the scattered intensity as a function of @xmath23 at the bulk orbital superlattice reflection ( @xmath21 ) and on the nominal otr at ( @xmath22 ) . \n the intensity at ( @xmath22 ) has a maximum around @xmath24 while a smooth increase is seen at ( @xmath21 ) with increasing @xmath23 , a result of the fact that more of the beam is intercepted by the sample at higher angles . \n since the exit angle @xmath29 for ( @xmath22 ) is 3 to 1.5 degrees in this scan region , the observed intensity maximum can not be due to a maximum in the sample illumination and detector acceptance , which happens at @xmath30 in our experimental configuration . \n therefore , we conclude that the scattering observed at ( 2 0 0.2)@xmath7(@xmath15 ) , shown in fig .  [ \n fig : oo - ctr ] ( a ) does indeed come from surface scattering and not from stacking faults or other bulk effects . \n this is the first such observation of the orbital truncation rod scattering . \n having established that such scattering originates from the truncation of the orbital order , we next discuss what can be learned from this new scattering . \n as shown in fig . \n [ fig : oo - ctr ] ( a ) , the transverse scan profile of the rod intensity for the chemical surface and for the orbital surface are quite different . \n this difference in the scattering profiles directly reflects a difference in the surface roughness.@xcite the sharp single peak observed for the chemical ctr scattering implies a very flat surface , and is consistent with the atomically smooth chemical surface observed in the afm picture ( fig . \n [ fig : chem_sur ] ( b ) ) . \n in contrast , the transverse profile of the orbital truncation rod exhibits two components ; a ` sharp ' one and a ` broad ' one . \n such a line shape is expected when a surface  in this case the orbital surface  has a well - defined average position ( a flat plane ) but local , finite deviations from this average@xcite . \n thus , without recourse to any model - dependent fitting we can immediately conclude from the data of fig.[fig : oo - ctr ] ( a ) that there exists a flat chemical surface and a rougher orbital order surface . \n a rougher surface also has the consequence that the intensity along the truncation rod must fall more sharply as a function of @xmath9 than for a less rough surface . \n figure  [ fig : oo - ctr ] ( b ) shows the intensity of the ( 20@xmath9 ) and ( @xmath25 ) rods as a function of @xmath9 measured on two samples ( cleaved in he , sample a , and in air , sample b ) at 100k , 170k , and 200k . for the orbital rod , \n the intensity of the sharp component integrated in the transverse direction is shown . \n note , the @xmath9-dependence of the ( 20@xmath9 ) intensity of sample a is slightly different from that of sample b , suggesting a slightly different degree of flatness of the chemical surface for the two samples . on the other hand , \n the ( @xmath25 ) intensity distribution for both samples is very similar and in both cases , the slope is steeper than that along ( 20@xmath9 ) . \n this is consistent with the result in fig . \n [ fig : oo - ctr ] ( a ) : the orbital order surface is rougher than the chemical surface . \n we next quantify this result by use of a model for a nearly flat surface due to andrews and cowley@xcite . in this model , the surface is characterized by two parameters : @xmath31 , the standard deviation of the surface height , and @xmath32 , the correlation length of the surface ( fig . \n [ fig : analysis ] ) . \n the truncation rod intensity distribution @xmath33 from such a surface is given by : @xmath34 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2q_z^4 }   \\nonumber\\\\&&\\times                \\exp\\left[\\frac{-(\\xi^{\\scriptsize { \\rm sur}})^2[1-\\exp(-\\sigma^2q_z^2)]}{4\\sigma^2q_z^2}(h^2+k^2)\\right],\\label{eq : ib}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the intensities for the sharp component and the broad component respectively , @xmath37 is the structure factor at scattering vector @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the @xmath5 * -component of the reduced wavevector ( e.g. this is @xmath40 for @xmath41 ) . in order to compare our data to the predictions of this model \n , we replace the delta - function in equation ( [ eq : is ] ) with a gaussian , to account for the finite bulk orbital correlation length , and fit the transverse scans to a two - gaussian lineshape as shown by the red solid curve in fig . \n [ fig : oo - ctr](a ) . \n the @xmath9-dependence of the parameters derived from these fits are shown in figure [ fig : analysis](a ) , which plots the ratio of the intensity of the broad component and the sharp component , and in figure [ fig : analysis](b ) , which shows the widths of the two components , for the 170  k data set .    . \n ( inset ) schematic view of the orbital order region around the surface . \n ( b ) peak widths of broad- and sharp- component . calculated values for the model discussed in the text are shown by solid lines in both figures.,width=264 ]    the intensity ratio @xmath42 increases rapidly with @xmath9 . \n this ratio depends mainly on @xmath31 , and hence @xmath31 may be obtained from the plot . the solid line in fig . \n [ fig : analysis](a ) shows the expected behaviour for @xmath27 , which reproduces the data quite well . \n note , this same value of @xmath31 is also consistent with the results shown in fig . \n [ fig : oo - ctr ] ( b ) ; the solid line in this latter figure is the calculated intensity distribution given by taking the product of the measured @xmath43 and @xmath44 , with @xmath31=6.7 ; here , we assumed the chemical surface is perfectly flat . \n the in - plane correlation length @xmath32 is given by the transverse peak width and is shown in fig . \n [ fig : analysis ] ( b ) as a function of @xmath9 , together with the @xmath9-dependence predicted by eq . \n ( [ eq : ib ] ) for a particular value of @xmath32 . using the value of @xmath27 , \n @xmath32 is found to be 120 . \n that is , the surface correlation length is much shorter than that of the bulk orbital order @xmath45 . \n this suggests that some aspect of the surface disrupts the orbital order . \n this may be due to differing surface energetics resulting from the reduced coordination , or perhaps varying sr concentrations at the site of the cleave . \n we next compare the present results to that of previous reports . \n leed measurements on the same material @xcite showed no superlattice intensity down to 80k , implying little orbital order is established in the topmost layer . \n our result is consistent with this study . \n the surface roughness in the orbital order observed here necessarily requires a small order parameter or a small ordered volume fraction at the surface . \n the same authors also performed stm measurements on the same system and found unidentified ` electronic roughness at the surface ' having an in - plane correlation length of several nanometres and surface roughness of 6 . comparing to the present results , \n one notes that the length scale of the roughness observed in the stm study is very similar to that of the orbital order interface observed in this study , and it is tempting to surmise that this ` electronic roughness ' may be related in some way to the rough orbital interface observed here . \n however , it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions on this point without further study . \n finally , we briefly discuss the temperature dependence of the orbital truncation rod scattering . \n figure [ fig : tdep ] shows the temperature dependence of the ( @xmath25)-sharp component intensity for @xmath462 , 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 r.l.u .    ) \n -sharp component intensity for @xmath462 , 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4.,width=264 ]    the temperature dependence of the surface - sensitive otr scattering intensity ( @xmath9=0.2 , 0.3 and 0.4 data ) is different from that of the bulk - sensitive superlattice reflection . \n the bulk oo transition was reported to be ` probably second order ' with a relatively discontinuous transition@xcite . \n in contrast , the temperature dependence of the otr scattering intensity is seen to evolve much more continuously through the transition . \n the bulk superlattice reflection intensity is proportional to the volume of the orbitally ordered phase , and to the square of the order parameter , or the jahn - teller distortion caused by the orbital ordering . \n in contrast , the otr intensity is proportional to the area of the orbital ordered flat surface and to the square of the order parameter . since the surface roughness of the oo phase at 100k is the same as that at 200  k , then the change in intensity must be attributed to a change in the magnitude of the atomic displacement , i.e. , in the orbital order parameter at the surface . \n thus , these data suggest that the surface orbital order parameter decays more continuously than the bulk . \n such phenomena may be related to surface - induced second order phase transitions that have been observed in other materials@xcite . \n future work will investigate this possibility in detail .    in conclusion , we have performed a surface x - ray scattering study of a cleaved , single - layered , half - doped manganite . \n the chemical surface was found to be extremely flat with a la / sr layer termination . \n importantly , we have observed the scattering arising from truncation of the orbital order at a surface for the first time . \n we find that the orbital surface is rougher than the chemical surface , and that its temperature dependence is different from the bulk orbital order , indicating a surface - induced second order transition . \n these results are further evidence of the importance of surface effects in determining electronic ground states in strongly correlated systems and provide a direct route to probe such effects quantitatively . \n detailed understanding will require theoretical models capable of dealing with such surface effects explicitly .",

[ \n fig : resonancefrequencyanglescan]a . \n the experimental data confirm the expected @xmath60-periodicity of the resonance frequency @xmath58 . from these data \n we extract the maximum resonance frequency shift @xmath61 ( see fig .  [ \n fig : resonancefrequencyanglescan]b ) . \n we observe slight deviations between the measured @xmath58 and the expected @xmath59 behaviour , especially around @xmath62 and @xmath63 . \n this is quantitatively understood as the magnetization for these angles @xmath11 is not perfectly aligned in parallel with the applied magnetic field due to the shape anisotropy of the nanobeam ( for details see supporting information ii ) .    to determine the magnetostriction constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 from the experimental data , we first calculate the static prestress @xmath64 in the nanobeam . with @xmath65 we get @xmath66 . \n here we have used the effective density @xmath67 , which we determine from @xmath68 ( see ref .  ) and @xmath69 ( see ref .  ) using @xmath70 ( see ref .  ) . with eq . \n ( [ eq : resfreqshift ] ) , the young s modulus of cobalt @xmath71 ( see ref .  ) and the relation @xmath27 , the observed maximum resonance frequency shift of @xmath72 corresponds to a magnetostriction constant of @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) .    for comparison with literature \n , we calculate the magnetostriction constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 in polycrystalline magnetically saturated cobalt from the crystal magnetostriction constants @xmath75 as described in ref .  , for which we obtain @xmath76 and @xmath77 . \n this is in very good agreement with the experimentally determined values . \n thus we conclude that the proposed method conforms with standard magnetostriction measurement techniques , which e.g.  use the bending of a cantilever covered with a thin magnetostrictive film@xcite , and is therefore suitable to quantitatively determine the magnetostriction constants of thin films . \n in contrast to cantilever - based experiments , where magnetostriction causes a bending of the mechanical element , the present approach uses a pre - stressed , doubly - clamped nanobeam where the magnetostrictive stress modifies the total stress along the beam axis and therefore changes the resonance frequency of the beam . \n this stress - to - frequency conversion allows for an effective determination of the magnetostriction constants via a frequency measurement , which does not rely on a quantitative measurement of the beam displacement ( as it is the case for cantilever - based techniques ) . \n the high quality factor of pre - stressed si@xmath2n@xmath3 nanobeam resonators@xcite therefore allows to precisely investigate magnetostriction in thin films . \n although the presented method only allows to experimentally access one stress direction ( i.e.  the stress component along the beam direction ) , it can be particularly useful for the investigation of very thin ( or nanopatterned ) magnetostrictive films with a high precision . \n the reason is that , as we will show in the following , the experimental uncertainty of the calculated magnetostriction constants does not necessarily increase for decreasing film thickness as it is the case for cantilever - based measurement techniques .    to illustrate this \n , we first calculate the stress - frequency gauge factor , i.e.  the change of the resonance frequency of the beam as a function of the stress variation . for the presented sample this is @xmath78 \n assuming a frequency measurement precision of @xmath79 ( with the linewidth of the resonance @xmath80 ) , this allows to resolve a stress variation of @xmath81 . \n this corresponds to an experimental uncertainty in the parallel magnetostriction constant of @xmath82 . using a phase - locked loop ( ppl ) to track the resonance frequency of the beam , however , would increase the frequency resolution significantly , allowing an uncertainty @xmath83 well below @xmath84 . \n this is comparable to other methods@xcite even though the thickness of our magnetostrictive film is only 10 nm . in particular , reducing the film thickness further does not necessarily reduce the measurement precision . \n this is due to the fact that the quality factor of a doubly - clamped si@xmath2n@xmath3 beam covered with a thin film typically strongly depends on the film thickness . for si@xmath2n@xmath3/au nanobeams , \n it has been shown recently that the inverse quality factor is proportional to the film thickness for au layers between 10 nm and 100 nm as the damping in a highly prestressed silicon nitride film is much lower than in the au film@xcite . \n therefore , for very thin magnetostrictive films on a highly prestressed si@xmath2n@xmath3 beam , the resonance frequency measurement uncertainty is proportional to the film thickness , @xmath85 . \n the uncertainty @xmath86 is therefore in first approximation independent of the film thickness ( assuming @xmath87 ) . \n this characteristic makes the proposed technique an ideal platform for the investigation of magnetostriction in thin and ultrathin films .    in this letter , we have proposed a new method to quantitatively investigate magnetostriction in thin films . to this end \n we use a si@xmath2n@xmath3 nanomechanical resonator covered with a thin magnetostrictive film . by measuring the resonance frequency of the fundamental vibrational mode of the beam as a function of an external magnetic field we can deduce the magnetostrictive stress along the beam direction and hence the magnetostriction constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 . compared to \n previously reported methods , the proposed technique does not rely on a quantitative measurement of the mechanical displacement , but utilizes a resonance frequency shift caused by magnetostriction . \n besides , it offers a measurement precision which is independent of the film thickness . \n this enables the investigation of ultrathin magnetostrictive films and paves the way to study magnetostriction as a function of the film thickness . \n the proposed technique can be applied to any conducting or insulating material which can be deposited on a si@xmath2n@xmath3 nanobeam via electron beam evaporation , thermal evaporation , sputtering etc . \n the material under investigation does not have to be etch - resistent as it is deposited on the nano - resonator as last step of the sample fabrication process . \n the authors thank dr . \n s.  gepraegs for fruitful discussions and gratefully acknowledge financial support by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft via project no . \n ko 416/18 and spincat go944/4 . \n 32ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] \n + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty link:\\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.105.027205 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1073/pnas.0812068106 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1016/j.physrep.2011.03.002 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1088/0034 -

    "models of exchange - bias in thin films have been able to describe various aspects of this technologically relevant effect . through appropriate choices of free parameters \n the modelled hysteresis loops adequately match experiment , and typical domain structures can be simulated . \n however , the use of these parameters , notably the coupling strength between the systems ferromagnetic ( f ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) layers , obscures conclusions about their influence on the magnetization reversal processes . \n here we develop a 2d phase - field model of the magnetization process in exchange - biased @xmath0 that incorporates the 10nm - resolved measured local biasing characteristics of the antiferromagnet . \n just three interrelated parameters set to measured physical quantities of the ferromagnet and the measured density of uncompensated spins thus suffice to match the experiment in microscopic and macroscopic detail . \n we use the model to study changes in bias and coercivity caused by different distributions of pinned uncompensated spins of the antiferromagnet , in application - relevant situations where domain wall motion dominates the ferromagnetic reversal . \n we show the excess coercivity can arise solely from inhomogeneity in the density of biasing- and anti - biasing pinned uncompensated spins in the antiferromagnet . \n counter to conventional wisdom , irreversible processes in the latter are not essential .    in coupled ferromagnetic- ( `` f '' ) and antiferromagnetic ( `` af '' ) thin films exchange - bias can arise for fixed af magnetic structures@xcite . \n the effect , widely used in contemporary magnetic devices such as giant- and tunnel - magnetoresistive thin - film sensors@xcite , is set up when the f structure `` imprints '' a stabilizing structure in the af upon cooling below the af nel temperature . \n it is manifested primarily as a lateral shift of the hysteresis loop of the f layer@xcite . \n often the width of the loop also increases with the onset of exchange - bias ( e.g.  @xcite ) , recently prompting studies of the use of this excess coercivity as a proxy for the degree of sub - monolayer co - oxidation@xcite . \n + microscopic model views of afs and f - af interfaces have provided insight into the mechanisms by which these features arise at the smallest scales@xcite . \n it is clear that one characteristic of the materials systems associated with exchange bias is the existence of pinned uncompensated spins antiparallel to the f - magnetization@xcite for co , fe or permalloy coupled to coo . \n the excess coercivity , on the other hand , has been circumscribed in the models to the effects of irreversible processes in the af@xcite . \n understanding these phenomena at scales that reveal domain wall motion in polycrystalline films is important because many ( if not most ) applications rely on magnetization reversal through this process  or their impediment@xcite . \n hence the relevance of work by fujiwara et al . \n and stiles et al.@xcite that studied the influence of distributions of af crystallite orientations and anisotropy in exchange bias \n . however , in these studies the evolution of domain walls in the f during reversal could not be accounted for because of the exceedingly high computational cost of modelling macroscopic systems . \n other works have recently overcome this limitation@xcite . \n but the role of the af / f coupling , which is perhaps the least well understood component of exchange bias , is obscured by the reliance on free parameters for its description , and by the large variety of experimental results .    with this work \n our goal is to _ avoid _ free parameters in a model description of f reversal processes in typical exchange bias systems . \n instead , we want to rely exclusively on measured ( or literature ) values for the samples described , and show how accurate a model description can be , as assessed from measured microscopic domain images in applied fields and from hysteresis loops . \n accordingly , the dispersion in the measured sample data used as model input must be small  hence we studied a single sample . \n in particular , on the contentious issue of the distribution of pinned uncompensated spins , we can use 10nm - resolved experimental data from schmid et al.@xcite . as for the coupling \n , its average can be deduced from magnetometry of the exchange - bias field @xmath1 . \n various statistics of the anisotropy of the af on a granular scale can be accessed with techniques such as that proposed by vallejo fernandez et al.@xcite . \n this information would be essential for a correct account of temperature dependent- and training phenomena , and lacking it , we do not attempt to describe these effects ( incorporating them would be possible , but beyond the scope of this work ) . \n the spatial distribution of f and af anisotropy on the other hand can not easily be furnished by experiment . so as not to shape the model outcome with our particular choice of distribution , we select the most general distribution possible , a gaussian one . \n improved models would base the anisotropy distributions on statistics of measured barkhausen avalanches in the sample@xcite , or infer spatial distributions from the marginal changes of domain boundaries with applied field at room temperature , where there is no exchange bias . \n our model is a 2d phase - field model , similar to those used to describe ferromagnetic films in relation to the role of disorder in domain dynamics . \n for instance , return point memory effects  @xcite , barkhausen avalanche distributions  @xcite , and the role of defects in the domain reorientation under the influence of an oscillating external field  @xcite have been investigated in this fashion . \n these studies did not attempt to match experiment quantitatively , in part because the local domain pinning strength was not known ; nor have they been implemented in the context of exchange - bias . from this perspective , our model differs from conventional ones in three important ways : first , it describes an exchange - bias system on a scale relevant for magnetization reversal processes governed by domain wall motion . \n second , it incorporates an experimentally determined@xcite 10nm - resolved distribution of f - af pinned uncompensated spins ( @xmath2 ) over the @xmath3m@xmath4 m area modelled . \n as we will show in the following , the inhomogeneity of pinned ucs affects @xmath1 and @xmath5@xcite . \n hence the importance of using experimental values for pinned ucs , and the implied refinement over previous models . and \n third , the model agrees quantitatively with the experimentally determined hysteresis loop and 10nm - resolved domain evolution , using for both scales one and the same set of material parameters that are in agreement with commonly accepted experimental values .",

    "imputation of missing data in large regions of satellite imagery is necessary when the acquired image has been damaged by shadows due to clouds , or information gaps produced by sensor failure . \n the general approach for imputation of missing data , that could not be considered missed at random , suggests the use of other available data . \n previous work , like local linear histogram matching , take advantage of a co - registered older image obtained by the same sensor , yielding good results in filling homogeneous regions , but poor results if the scenes being combined have radical differences in target radiance due , for example , to the presence of sun glint or snow . \n this study proposes three different alternatives for filling the data gaps . \n the first two involves merging radiometric information from a lower resolution image acquired at the same time , in the fourier domain ( method a ) , and using linear regression ( method b ) . the third method consider segmentation as the main target of processing , and propose a method to fill the gaps in the map of classes , avoiding direct imputation ( method c ) . \n all the methods were compared by means of a large simulation study , evaluating performance with a multivariate response vector with four measures : q , rmse , kappa and overall accuracy coefficients . difference in performance \n were tested with a manova mixed model design with two main effects , imputation method and type of lower resolution extra data , and a blocking third factor with a nested sub - factor , introduced by the real landsat image and the sub - images that were used . \n method b proved to be the best for all criteria .",

    "i present a brief review of present cgc phenomenological applications and of the physics prospects for the forthcoming proton - lead run at the lhc    color glass condensate , high - density qcd , lhc    besides its crucial role as a reference experiment to calibrate initial state effects in heavy ion collisions , the forthcoming p+pb run at the lhc will provide access to kinematic regions never explored so far in nuclear collisions and thus carries great potential for discovery of new qcd phenomena on its own . in particular , the huge leap forward in collision energy with respect to previous high energy electron - nucleus or proton - nucleus experiments will probe the nuclear wave function at values of bjorken-@xmath0 smaller than ever before . \n it is theoretically well established that at small enough values of bjorken-@xmath0 qcd enters a novel regime governed by large gluon densities and non - linear coherence phenomena . \n the color glass condensate ( cgc ) effective theory provides a consistent framework to study qcd scattering at small-@xmath0 or high collision energies ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) . \n it is based on three main physical ingredients : first , high gluon densities correspond to strong classical fields , which permit ab - initio first principles calculation of `` wave functions '' at small @xmath0 through classical techniques . \n next , quantum corrections are incorporated via non - linear renormalization group equations such as the b - jimwlk hierarchy or , in the large-@xmath1 limit , the bk equation  @xcite that describe the evolution of the hadron wave function towards small @xmath0 . \n the non - linear , density - dependent terms in the cgc evolution equations are ultimately related to unitarity of the theory and , in the appropriate frame and gauge , can be interpreted as due to gluon recombination processes that tame or _ \n saturate _ the growth of gluon densities for modes with transverse momenta below a dynamically generated scale known as the saturation scale , @xmath2 . \n finally , the presence of strong color fields @xmath3 leads to breakdown of standard perturbative techniques to describe particle production processes based on a series expansion in powers of the strong coupling @xmath4 . \n terms of order @xmath5 need to be resummed to all orders . \n the cgc provides the tools to perform such resummation although the precise prescription for the resummation may vary from process to process or colliding system    while the cgc has been successfully applied to the description of different observables in different collision systems ( from e+p to aa ) , the p+pb run at the lhc will provide an excellent and probably in the near future unique possibility to disentangle the presently inconclusive situation on the role of cgc effects and also to distinguish among different approaches to describe high energy scattering in nuclear reactions . on the one hand , the lhc shall bring us closer to the limit of asymptotically high energy in which the cgc formalism is developed , thus reducing theoretical uncertainties on its applicability . \n equivalently , the value of the saturation scale is expected to be a factor @xmath6 times larger than at rhic , so saturation effects should be visible in a larger range of transverse momenta , deeper into the perturbative domain . on the other hand , the much extended reach in the lhc will allow measurements far from the kinematic limit up to very forward rapidities , thus minimizing the role of large-@xmath0 effects which obscured the interpretation of forward rhic data .",

channel kondo model . \n this lends additional support to the conclusion of costi _ et al . \n _  that the latter model provides a good effective description of the kondo physics of iron impurities in gold and silver .    the magnetic alloys for which the kondo effect was first observed , in the 1930s , were iron impurities in gold and silver @xcite \n they showed an anomalous rise in the resistivity with decreasing temperature , which kondo explained in 1964 as being due to an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the localized magnetic impurity spins and the spins of the delocalized conduction electrons @xcite . \n for his work , kondo used a spin-@xmath2 , one - band model , which undoubtedly captures the essential physics correctly in a qualitative way . \n however , detailed comparisons between theory and experiment have since shown that this model does not yield a \n _ quantitatively _ correct description of the kondo physics of dilute fe impurities in au or ag . \n such a description must meet the challenge of quantitatively reproducing , using the kondo temperature @xmath3 as only fitting parameter , several independent sets of experimental measurements : the contributions by magnetic impurities ( indicated by a subscript m ) to the temperature- and field - dependence of the resistivity , @xmath4 , and to the temperature - dependence of the decoherence rate , @xmath5 , extracted from weak ( anti)localization measurements . \n the spin-@xmath2 , 1-band kondo model does not meet this challenge : when comparing its predictions , obtained by the numerical renormalization group ( nrg)@xcite , to transport measurements on dilute fe impurities in ag wires , different kondo scales were required for fitting the resistivity and decoherence rates @xcite .    in a recent publication ( ref .  , involving most of the present authors , henceforth referred to as paper i ) , it was argued that the proper effective low - energy kondo model for fe in au or ag is , in fact , a fully screened , spin-@xmath1 three - channel kondo model . \n paper  i  arrived at this conclusion by the following chain of arguments . \n previous transport experiments@xcite had indicated that these systems are described by a fully screened kondo model@xcite , i.e.  a kondo model in which the local spin , @xmath6 , is related to the number of conduction bands , @xmath7 , by @xmath8 . \n as mentioned above , the choice @xmath9 had already been ruled out in earlier work @xcite . \n density - functional theory calculations for fe in au and ag , presented in paper  i , showed that in these host metals fe preferentially acts as a substitutional defect with cubic symmetry , leading to a substantial crystal field splitting ( @xmath10  ev ) between a higher - lying @xmath11 doublet and a lower - lying @xmath12 triplet . \n moreover , the local spin moment was predicted to be 3 bohr magnetons , with an almost fully quenched orbital angular momentum . \n this suggested a fully - screened kondo model with @xmath13 as the most likely candidate , while leaving some scope for the possibility of @xmath14 ( but none for @xmath15 or 5 ) . to discriminate between the options @xmath14 and 3 , @xmath16 and @xmath5 \n were then calculated using nrg , for @xmath9 ( as reference ) , 2 and 3 . \n next , for both material systems ( fe in au and ag ) , the @xmath16 curves were fitted to experimental data to obtain a kondo temperature , @xmath17 , for each of the three models . finally , using these @xmath17-values , the @xmath5 curves , which constituted parameter - free predictions of the decoherence rate , \n were compared to corresponding measurements , with the conclusion that the choice @xmath13 worked distinctly better than @xmath14 . \n the goal of the present paper is two - fold : first , we describe technical details of the numerical calculations performed in paper  i that could not be presented there for lack of space . \n second and more important , we extend the analysis of paper  i to the case of finite magnetic fields . \n indeed , though experimental data for @xmath18 had been available for fe in ag even at the time of writing of paper  i , it had not been possible then to compare them to theoretical predictions for @xmath13 . \n the reason is that multichannel calculations present an enormous challenge for the nrg , as the numerical complexity grows exponentially with the number of channels . in paper \n i only abelian symmetries ( charge conservation in each channel and total spin @xmath19 ) were exploited . for the purposes of paper \n i , this turned out to be sufficient , but for the aforementioned three - channel kondo model the calculations were numerically extremely costly , and even at @xmath20 just barely within the limits of feasibility . when the present authors attempted , in subsequent work ( unpublished ) , to treat the more general case of a finite magnetic field using the same approach , the latter turned out to be inadequate , plagued by numerical convergence issues . \n therefore , further progress required enhancing the numerical efficiency by exploiting non - abelian symmetries . \n now , the effective fully screened symmetric three - channel kondo model mentioned above has several _ \n non_-abelian symmetries , including , in particular , an su(3 ) channel symmetry . \n this implies that the eigenspectrum of the hamiltonian can be organized into degenerate symmetry multiplets , and great gains in numerical efficiency can be made by exploiting this multiplet structure at every step of the nrg procedure . \n we took this observation as incentive to implement non - abelian symmetries in our code on a completely generic footing for tensor networks such as the nrg.@xcite although the exploitation of symmetries , abelian as well as non - abelian , together with their respective strong gain in numerical efficiency is well known in the literature , the treatment of non - abelian symmetries in nrg has been largely restricted to the symmetry of su(2 ) @xcite . the non - abelian symmetry su(2 ) , however , is simpler than the general case , since for @xmath21 the @xmath22 representation theory involves complications due to the presence of inner and outer multiplicities . \n a generic numerical framework for treating arbitrary non - abelian symmetries thus had been missing , and became available only very recently.@xcite    more specifically , the model hamiltonians studied here possess su(2 ) particle - hole symmetry , @xmath22 channel symmetry , and su(2 ) spin symmetry for @xmath20 or abelian @xmath19 symmetry for @xmath23 . by exploiting the non - abelian symmetries , we were able to drastically reduce the computational effort and generate fully converged numerical data , even for the highly challenging case of three channels . with a significantly more powerful nrg at our hands \n then , the following analysis serves two purposes . \n first , we present a thorough reanalysis of paper  i with improved nrg data . \n in particular , we give a detailed discussion of nrg truncation and convergence issues , which are under much better control with the new non - abelian scheme . \n the new numerical results show discernible quantitative differences w.r.t . \n paper  i , leading to changes in the deduced kondo temperatures that are quite substantial for @xmath13 ( the relative change in @xmath3 is 31% for fe in au and 53% for fe in ag ) . \n second , we present a detailed analysis of the new numerical magnetoresistivity data and compare these to experimental results for fe in ag . \n the results of both analyses fully confirm the main conclusion of paper  i : the effective microscopic model for dilute iron impurities in the noble metals gold and silver is given by a fully screened three - channel kondo model . \n the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : sec . \n [ sec : model ] describes the model , sec . \n [ sec : nrgdetails ] describes nrg - related details . \n sec . \n [ sec : comparison ] provides a comparison of experimental and numerical magnetoresistance data , followed by a summary in sec . \n [ sec : conclusions ] .",

yan cross sections induced by charged pions on an isoscalar target ( the deuteron ) . \n the second experiment involved semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering involving charged pion production in @xmath31 interactions .    in this report \n , we consider another possible experimental test of parton charge symmetry . \n this involves measurements of @xmath32 production at hadron colliders , specifically @xmath32-boson production in high energy @xmath33 collisions . \n this was initially suggested by vigdor @xcite . \n boros  made estimates of the effects that might be expected at colliders such as rhic and lhc @xcite , and concluded that one might expect several percent effects in certain observables . \n however , these effects occurred because the authors had assumed very large charge symmetry violation in the parton sea . \n this large sea quark csv was necessary to account for significant discrepancies between the @xmath34 structure functions extracted from high energy @xmath35 interactions measured by the nmc collaboration @xcite , and the @xmath34 from @xmath36 dis measured by ccfr @xcite . \n however , these discrepancies disappeared when the neutrino reactions were re - analyzed  @xcite . \n there were two reasons for significant changes of @xmath37 upon re - analysis . \n first , experimental neutrino cross - sections measure a combination of @xmath34 and @xmath38 . in the initial analysis \n the quantity @xmath38 was calculated from phenomenological pdfs . in the re - analysis \n , this quantity was extracted from experiment , by using the fact that the two structure functions have different @xmath39 dependences in the cross sections . \n the value of @xmath38 that was extracted differed considerably from the phenomenological @xmath38 , and this subsequently changed the value of @xmath34 that was extracted . \n the second significant change arose through the use of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) equations for charm quark mass effects  @xcite , rather than the `` slow re - scaling '' model @xcite . \n although the mrst analysis found evidence for sea quark csv @xcite , it was considerably smaller than that extracted from the original data , including the slow re - scaling contribution . \n the cross sections for the processes @xmath40 and @xmath41 have the form & & dd(pd w^+ x ) ~+ + & & + & & dd(pd w^- x ) ~+ + & & + [ eq : dsigdxf ]    in the absence of csv terms , if we take the sum of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 cross sections , ( ) ( dd)^w^+ + ( dd)^w^-  , [ eq : sigmass ] then the cabibbo favored terms in @xmath44 are invariant under the exchange @xmath45 , or alternatively under the transformation @xmath46 , where @xmath47 . \n consequently , we define the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath48 as a ( ) = _ ( ) - _ ( - ) _ ( ) + _ ( - ) [ eq : axf ] the only terms remaining in the quantity @xmath48 are charge symmetry violating terms , plus terms containing strange quarks in the cabibbo - unfavored sector .    we have calculated the effects to be expected for the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath48 for @xmath32-production at a hadron collider , using the charge symmetry violating pdfs calculated by the mrst group . \n we have used pdfs corresponding to three different sources of charge symmetry violation . \n first , we used the valence quark and sea quark csv pdfs extracted by the mrst group from global fits to high energy data @xcite . \n then we have added the csv pdfs calculated by the mrst group by including the `` qed '' contributions to qcd evolution , with assumptions about the parton distributions at the starting scale @xmath25 gev@xmath15 @xcite . \n note that the various csv pdfs were extracted using different procedures . \n the valence and sea quark pdfs were calculated in independent global fits to high energy data . in these fits , \n one assumed a particular functional form for the valence ( or sea ) quark csv pdfs , which depended upon an overall variable parameter for the strength . that parameter was determined by minimizing the @xmath49 of the global fit . \n for simplicity mrst neglected the @xmath3 dependence of the csv distributions .    in these various global fits , \n one obtains different valence parton distributions in the minimization process ( the sea quark and gluon distributions were essentially identical to those obtained assuming charge symmetry ) . \n so the best fit valence quark pdfs obtained by mrst when they allowed valence quark csv differed somewhat from those obtained when they allowed sea quark csv . \n in addition , the mrst global fits that allowed parton csv did not explicitly include the `` qed '' contributions to qcd evolution . \n we explore the various contributions to the @xmath32 production asymmetry , despite some questions regarding the consistency in the different parton distributions that give rise to csv effects .    in fig . \n [ fig : afig ] , we plot the forward - backward asymmetry expected for @xmath32 production , as defined in eq . \n [ eq : axf ] . \n the parton distribution functions are obtained from the mrst analysis that includes the `` qed '' contribution to dglap evolution ; this analysis includes electromagnetic couplings in the evolution equations that give rise to isospin violation @xcite , as given by eq . \n [ eq : qedevol ] . \n the input data for these global fits was that used in the mrst2004 analysis @xcite . \n the top figure is calculated for @xmath50 gev , and the bottom figure is calculated for @xmath51 gev . \n all three curves in fig . \n [ fig : afig ] include the sea quark csv terms from eq . \n [ eq : seacsv ] . \n they differ in the amount of valence quark csv of the type given by eq . \n [ eq : csvmrst ] . in each graph \n , the solid line corresponds to no valence csv ( @xmath52 ) , while the short -

dashed curve : @xmath54 ; short - dashed curve : @xmath53 . \n [ fig : afig],title=\"fig:\",width=316 ]    fig . \n [ fig : afig ] shows that the sea quark csv and the qed isospin violation tend to produce negative forward - backward @xmath32 asymmetries . \n the contributions from valence quark csv , with magnitudes at the 90% confidence level extracted by mrst , contribute a roughly equal magnitude to the asymmetries produced by the other sources of csv . \n for negative values of @xmath2 , which agree with theoretical estimates of valence quark csv @xcite , the valence csv terms tend to cancel the asymmetry produced by sea quark csv ; while for positive values of @xmath2 the various sources of isospin violation tend to add . \n note that the predicted forward - backward asymmetries are quite small . \n the magnitude is less than @xmath57 for almost all values of @xmath55 . \n these results are considerably smaller than those obtained by boros  @xcite , who predicted rather large positive values for @xmath48 , as large as @xmath58 for @xmath59 . \n there are two reasons for this difference . \n first , the sea quark csv terms are substantially smaller for mrst than those extracted by boros , by a factor of five or six ; the sea quark csv terms obtained by mrst and boros also have opposite signs . \n second , with the very large values of sea quark csv extracted by boros , the cabibbo unfavored terms were negligible . \n however , with the much smaller sea quark csv obtained by mrst , the cabibbo unfavored terms can no longer be neglected , and they tend to cancel the cabibbo favored contribution . \n this calculation of the forward - backward asymmetry for @xmath32 production finds that the expected effects are quite small , generally less than one percent for the range of csv effects obtained by mrst . with the expected levels of isospin violation in pdfs \n , it will be necessary to measure these asymmetries to better than one percent if this observable is to provide a test for charge symmetry violation in parton distributions .",

error correction ( [ eq_prob ] ) is included . \n the very good agreement with the data further supports the quality of the blockade . \n our results are compatible with the prediction of the model of double excitation probability @xmath75 for the same experimental parameters . \n although proving experimentally that the double excitation is that low would require a more detailed study of systematic effects , this figure is very encouraging for high - fidelity generation of three - atom @xmath76 states .    in the results discussed so far , we only considered a 1d configuration . \n for scalability to a large number of atoms , however , 2d arrays of traps are preferable . in this case \n , some atom pairs necessarily have an internuclear axis not aligned along the quantization axis and the anisotropy of the interaction comes into play , which might eventually prevent a perfect blockade @xcite . to investigate this effect we study the blockade in an equilateral triangle configuration . here , the anisotropic character of the @xmath77state orbital plays a role and the interaction energies between atom pairs @xmath78 are weaker than @xmath79 , although the atoms are equally separated . despite this , figure  [ fig : fig2](c ) shows that the strength of the blockade is not reduced in the triangular geometry . \n double and triple excitation probabilities are inhibited and the single excitation probability oscillates at @xmath80 . \n this result opens encouraging prospects for achieving strong blockade over 2d arrays of atoms .    in order to observe directly the anisotropy of the interaction  @xcite we measured the interaction energy between atom pairs separated by @xmath81 as a function of the angle @xmath82 between the internuclear axis and the quantization axis @xmath12 . \n the procedure to extract the effective interaction energy @xmath4 is similar to the one introduced in ref . \n @xcite . \n working in the partial blockade regime ( @xmath83 ) , we model the excitation dynamics through the solution of the optical bloch equations ( obe ) involving two - level atoms . strictly speaking , to model two atoms in the @xmath84 state and @xmath85 \n , one would need to consider all 49 zeeman sublevels with their different van der waals couplings  @xcite . so as to keep the model tractable , even for large number of atoms , we model the system in the simplest non - trivial way , retaining only one single doubly excited state @xmath86 with an effective energy shift @xmath87 . \n all input parameters are obtained from single - atom rabi oscillation experiments . \n the measured dynamics of the two - atom system are then fitted with the solution of the obes with @xmath4 as the only fitting parameter . \n a more detailed study of the angular dependence of the van der waals interaction , taking into account the full zeeman structure of the atom pair , is beyond the scope of this letter and will be the subject of future work .     for two atoms in @xmath88 at @xmath81 , with @xmath82 the angle between the internuclear axis and the quantization axis @xmath12 . \n red squares indicate the measured energy shifts @xmath79 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 used for the simulation of three - atom dynamics in the partial blockade regime ( see fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] ) . in the inset , \n the angular dependence of the interaction for the spherically symmetric @xmath91 state is shown for comparison . \n error bars represent one standard deviation confidence intervals in the fits.,width=321 ]    the result of this approach is shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] for the @xmath88 state . \n the anisotropy of the effective interaction is evident . \n the energy shift shows a maximum around @xmath92 and decreases for larger angles . \n a relative change of interaction strength by a factor @xmath93 is measured when @xmath82 varies from @xmath92 to @xmath94 . \n in contrast , for a spherically symmetric @xmath95rydberg state , the interaction energy is isotropic ( see inset of fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] )  -state , the polarisations of the 795  nm ( resp . \n 474  nm ) lasers are @xmath35 ( resp @xmath96 ) . ] \n for the @xmath77-state , we observe an unexpected , slight asymmetry in the angular dependence of @xmath4 , probably due to small systematic effects  .    , @xmath97,@xmath98 , and triple excitation @xmath99 versus excitation pulse area @xmath100 for driving rabi frequencies @xmath101 ( a ) , and @xmath1021.6 mhz ( b ) in the triangular configuration . \n the distance between the traps is @xmath103 m . \n the ratio between effective pairwise interaction energies is @xmath104 3 for @xmath105 60@xmath106 . \n solid lines are the solution of the obes without any adjustable parameter.,width=321 ]    the angular dependence of @xmath4 manifests itself in the interaction dynamics of the three atoms in the triangular configuration . by increasing the sides of the triangle to @xmath81 , \n the effective interaction energies become @xmath107 ( see red squares in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] ) , and the blockade is only partial for our chosen rabi frequency @xmath108 . in fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] we show the populations of doubly ( @xmath109 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) and triply ( @xmath99 ) excited states for two different rabi frequencies . in the first dataset [ fig . \n [ fig : fig4](a ) ] , @xmath101 and the anisotropy in the binary interaction ( @xmath110 ) is directly observed in the dynamics : the probability @xmath97 to detect double excitation of atoms 1 and 3 is almost totally suppressed , while it is appreciable for @xmath109 and @xmath98 . \n those two curves show almost the same dynamics , as expected . \n triple excitations are totally blocked in this regime . for comparison , we show also the dynamics when a slightly higher rabi frequency @xmath111 is used [ fig .  [ \n fig : fig4](b ) ] . \n this corresponds to a partial blockade regime where @xmath112 . in this case , even triple excitations are not completely blockaded . @xmath109 and @xmath98 also exhibit similar behavior , while @xmath97 shows different dynamics . \n the populations of states carrying only single excitations also show the anisotropy  @xcite . \n many - body effects have largely been recognized to play a key role in the modeling of systems in physics and chemistry  @xcite . in the case of rydberg atoms \n they have been invoked to explain anomalous broadenings of frster resonances  @xcite . to understand the evolution of the population of the states during excitation and to investigate to what extent few - atom many - body physics \n can be described from pairwise interactions we perform again a simulation using the obes for the three - atom system . in the model , with no adjustable parameters , the measured interaction energies at @xmath92 and @xmath94 ( red squares in fig .  [ \n fig : fig3 ] ) are introduced . as shown by the solid lines in fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] , the simulation ( where atom loss correction is included ) fully reproduces the experimental data . \n the fact that the simulation can accurately describe the evolution of the triply excited state @xmath99 suggests that , for our choice of parameters , the pairwise addition of van der waals level shifts @xmath113 is valid to a very good approximation . \n however , this additivity of the potential may not hold in the case of resonant dipole - dipole interactions . there \n , quantum interference between different many - body interaction channels can influence the dynamics  @xcite . \n all these processes can be studied for rydberg atoms close to frster resonance and will be the subject of future work . \n another interesting line of research will consist in studying the recently predicted borromean trimers bound by the dipole - dipole interaction  @xcite .    in summary \n , we have investigated the dynamics of a system of three rydberg atoms in both full and partial blockade regimes . \n we observe a strong van der waals blockade of the excitations and coherent rabi oscillations for two different spatial configurations . \n for the same experimental parameters in the equilateral triangle arrangement , the anisotropy of the interaction potential between @xmath1 states does not prevent the observation of a strong van der waals blockade , which is a prerequisite for the scalability of quantum information processing proposals using 2d arrays of dipole traps . \n the strong blockade achieved and the small damping of the oscillations paves the way for the generation of many - atom entanglement with high fidelity through the rydberg blockade  @xcite . in the partial blockade regime , the angular dependence of the interaction energy shift between two atoms has been measured for the @xmath88 and @xmath91 rydberg states . \n furthermore , we have shown that with the measured effective energy shifts it is possible to reproduce the three - atom dynamics with high accuracy . \n this result demonstrates that one can confidently scale those studies for 2d arrays of more than a few atoms , enabling the quantum simulation of large - size , long -

top molecules have been suggested to be ideally suited to simulate quantum magnetism  @xcite . \n moreover , precision tests of physics based on chirality require molecules with at least four atoms  @xcite . \n in addition , single large molecules have been suggested for the realization of an entire quantum computer , using different vibrational modes to encode individual qubits  @xcite . \n last but not least , the high vapor pressure for many polyatomic molecule species , even at room temperature , allows the efficient generation of high - density initial ensembles  @xcite .    a key challenge for obtaining cold and ultracold molecular ensembles has been gaining and maintaining control of the internal molecular state . while this is true for molecules in general , it is particularly problematic for larger , polyatomic molecules . \n thus , even for the relatively light molecule ch@xmath0f discussed here , several thousand rotational states are populated at room temperature . for larger molecules , \n a huge number of states is populated even at liquid - helium temperatures . \n gaining quantum - state control of such molecules requires some form of internal - state cooling . while internal - state cooling has been demonstrated for bialkali dimers  @xcite as well as for a number of diatomic molecular ions  @xcite , its implementation for polyatomic molecules is lacking .    in this letter \n , we demonstrate comprehensive internal -

shifted transitions coupling the three highest @xmath1-sublevels can be clearly identified proving a transfer of molecules from @xmath55 to @xmath56 . \n lower lying @xmath1-substates yield smaller or negligible peaks because these are less populated initially and the chance of losing the corresponding molecules to untrapped states during the pumping process is higher . \n a key advantage of our rsc scheme is that it can be integrated straightforwardly with motional sisyphus cooling and thus enables the simultaneous cooling of the internal and external degrees of freedom . \n sisyphus cooling is expected to provide temperatures below for many molecule species and was first demonstrated with the same experimental apparatus in 2012  @xcite . in that work \n ch@xmath0f molecules populating the states @xmath57 were motionally cooled from @xmath58{k}$ ] to @xmath59{mk}$ ] . as the main difference to rsc , \n kinetic energy is extracted by driving radio frequency transitions ( to ) from a highest @xmath1-substate to a lower @xmath1 in edge regions of the trap with high electric field . \n molecules are optically pumped back to the initial , strongly trapped states by driving the @xmath60 vibrational transitions from @xmath14 in the homogeneous - electric - field region ( with lower electric fields ) . due to the spontaneous decay to @xmath3 \n we additionally couple the @xmath61 ( @xmath43 ) rotational states with mw radiation to obtain a closed level scheme . in this way \n , a large fraction of a molecule s kinetic energy can be extracted in each cooling cycle and several repetitions are possible with minimal losses to untrapped states . \n we demonstrate the concurrent motional and rotational cooling by adding the rsc to the sisyphus cooling sequence . \n the addition of rsc results in an equally cold , but larger ensemble of molecules . by applying rsc only during trap loading and the subsequent second , \n almost all molecules entering the trap in the states @xmath36 are pumped to @xmath3 . \n as expected from the initial rotational - state distribution , this increases the signal of cold molecules by 49(4)% . by continuing the optical pumping during the entire motional - cooling sequence we increase the signal by 76(4)% . \n this closes two loss channels of the sisyphus scheme specific to @xmath62 which transfer population to the @xmath63 state . \n these loss channels are the presence of a fermi resonance in the vibrationally excited state  @xcite and an excitation of a distinct vibrational mode by blackbody radiation ( estimated excitation rate )  @xcite . \n the rsc demonstrated thus far leaves molecules in a number of @xmath1-sublevels in the states @xmath53 , or , combined with sisyphus cooling , in the two states @xmath64 and @xmath65  @xcite . \n as a final experiment , we now show the preparation of the cooled molecular sample in the single rotational @xmath1-substate @xmath65 . \n this can be achieved by appending another optical pumping scheme to the experimental sequence for combined rotational and motional cooling . \n specifically , we drive the vibrational transitions @xmath41 from @xmath14 and @xmath66 from @xmath3 together with the rsc described above ( @xmath67 ) . \n this leads to @xmath65 being the only dark state in the manifold @xmath68 . to characterize this single - state preparation ( ssp ) process , \n we first evenly distribute the population of the cooled molecular ensemble among the states @xmath64 and @xmath65 by coupling the two with mw . \n the molecules in @xmath65 are then measured with or without of ssp applied . \n we find that ssp increases the absolute number of molecules populating the state @xmath65 by 70 ( 3)% , with this number also yielding the optical - pumping efficiency . \n a slight modification of the scheme also allows pumping from @xmath65 to @xmath64 , specifically by driving a @xmath66 transition from @xmath14 and a @xmath41 transition from @xmath3 . \n this yields a transfer efficiency of 50(5)% , where the reduced value is a consequence of less favorable branching ratios . \n the presented experiments show that we can significantly increase the population in a highest @xmath1-sublevel of choice . \n we estimate  @xcite that finally about @xmath69 cooled molecules populate the target state . \n state for the following experimental sequences : reference : no state manipulation @xmath70 ; rsc : rotational cooling as presented in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] @xmath71 ; rsc + sisyphus : motional cooling combined with rsc @xmath72 ; ssp : the previous sequence with subsequent optical pumping to @xmath65 @xmath73 ; ssp + cleaning : in addition to ssp removal of all states except for the @xmath65 state from the trap @xmath74 . \n the internal - state purity increases to 70% , while the mean kinetic energy is reduced by more than an order of magnitude . \n the vertical solid lines represent the @xmath40 statistical error ( which is smaller than the edge of the bar if not visible ) . \n the values for uncooled ensembles overestimate the population relative to the other sequences due to an imperfect state detection  @xcite . ] \n all previous measurements examined optical pumping in the context of increasing the absolute number of molecules in a particular state or set of states . in the final part of this letter we study the state purity of the molecular ensemble . \n the measured relative populations of @xmath65 ( normalized to the total trap signal ) resulting from different preparation procedures are presented and explained in fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] . mainly two processes \n enhance the rotational - state purity of the trapped sample of molecules in the course of the shown experiments : apart from optical pumping , which is specifically applied for this reason , filtering occurs as a side effect of motional sisyphus cooling . during motional cooling , molecules initially populating states outside the closed cycling scheme consisting of @xmath75 , @xmath52 and @xmath76 are coupled to untrapped states with a slow rate  @xcite . \n consequently , translational cooling alone leads to a significant increase of purity , since afterwards almost all molecules populate the states @xmath64 and @xmath65 . \n however , deliberate optical pumping to the target state @xmath65 ( ssp ) yields the greatest effect on state purity as can be expected from the previous discussions . \n the relative occupation is boosted a bit further by removing all molecules still populating states other than the dark state of the ssp scheme ( so - called cleaning ) .    in total , we augment the population of a single @xmath1-sublevel from initially @xmath77% to at least 70% while the molecular ensemble is motionally cooled by more than an order of magnitude . \n in fact , we even expect @xmath78% of the molecules to populate this particular rotational state , as our detection method underestimates the real occupation by roughly 20%  @xcite . \n the achieved purity is mainly limited by the above discussed blackbody radiation , which removes molecules from the target state during application of ssp and cleaning with a rate of . \n this limitation is of technical nature and can be eliminated by cooling down the electric trap or choosing a molecule species not suffering from significant blackbody - radiation losses .    by applying the extremely useful technique of optical pumping to trapped , \n neutral , polyatomic molecules we demonstrate unprecedented control of this system . starting from many initial states and pumping into a single final state \n we produce a pure ensemble of cooled molecules making use of only a single laser and microwave radiation . \n the final rotational state can in principle be chosen freely . \n our scheme is based on generic properties common to many molecule species and should therefore be applicable to a whole class of trappable molecules . \n thus , as a next step , we plan on internally cooling heavier molecules which populate numerous internal states even at cryogenic temperatures . \n this extends the number of species accessible to motional sisyphus cooling . \n comprehensive internal - state control also gives new prospects for high precision measurements or state resolved collision studies . finally , extending our scheme to pump into the absolute ground state  @xcite creates favorable conditions for the investigation of sympathetic or evaporative cooling of polyatomic molecules . \n 28ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] \n + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty link:\\doibase 10.1038/nphys386 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1038/nphys287 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1038/nature10104 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1080/00268976.2013.813595 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1126/science.1163861 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1038/nature11595 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1103/physreva.88.043424 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1103/physrevlett.112.013001 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1038/nature13634 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1103/physrevlett.112.113006 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1002/andp.201300105 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1088/1367 -

    "it is assumed that in seyfert galaxies the gas - dusty medium exits near the centre in the form of a molecular and dusty torus and equatorial flow . \n these objects have spectral lines emission of hydrogen , helium and other atoms . \n we derived the spectral line radiative transfer equation for such media . \n this equation has dimensionless extinction factor of the form : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 describes the shape of spectral line emerging from excited atom and @xmath2 . \n small factor @xmath3 is proportional to absorption cross - section , describing the collisional destruction of the resonance photons . \n the factor @xmath4 describes the extinction of the line radiation due to scattering on non - resonant atoms and due to absorption in dust grains . \n the term of transfer equation describing the scattering on resonant atoms is proportional to @xmath5 . \n thus , the radiative transfer equation depends on only one parameter @xmath6 , independent of frequency @xmath7 . using the known method of resolvent matrices \n , we obtain the exact solution of vectorial radiative transfer equation for various sources of non - polarized radiation in semi - infinite atmosphere . \n homogeneous , linear increasing and exponentially decreasing sources are considered . \n we present the intensity and linear polarization values for radiation emerging from semi - infinite medium for different values of parameter @xmath6 . \n we consider the doppler shape of a spectral line which is a good approximation for central part of the spectral line . \n the @xmath6 - dependence of shape of the line , angular distribution of radiation and the polarization degree is presented . \n * keywords * : radiative transfer , spectral lines , scattering , gas - dusty atmosphere    @xmath8 e - mail : nsilant@bk.ru",

    "we present in this paper a numerical study of the vibrational eigenvectors of a two - dimensional amorphous material , previously deeply studied from the point of view of mechanical properties and vibrational eigen - frequencies @xcite . \n attention is paid here to the connection between the mechanical properties of this material in term of elastic heterogeneities ( eh ) , and how these inherent heterogeneous structures affect the vibrational eigenvectors and their plane waves decomposition . \n the systems are analysed for different hydrostatic pressures , and using results from previous studies , a deeper understanding of the boson peak scenario is obtained . \n the vibrational spectrum of a continuously densified silica glass is also studied , from which it appears that the pulsation associated with the boson peak follows the same pressure dependence trend than that of transverse waves with pulsation associated with the eh characteristic size .",
