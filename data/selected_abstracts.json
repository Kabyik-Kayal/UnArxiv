    "in order to extend the spectral action principle to non - compact spaces , we propose a framework for spectral triples where the algebra may be non - unital but the resolvent of the dirac operator remains compact . \n we show that an example is given by the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator which , interestingly , provides two different dirac operators . \n this leads to two different representations of the volume form in the hilbert space , and only their product is the grading operator . \n the index of the even - to - odd part of each of these dirac operators is @xmath0 . \n we also compute the spectral action for the corresponding connes - lott two - point model . \n there is an additional harmonic oscillator potential for the higgs field , whereas the yang - mills part is unchanged . \n the total higgs potential shows a two - phase structure with smooth transition between them : in the spontaneously broken phase below a critical radius , all fields are massive , with the higgs field mass slightly smaller than the ncg prediction . in the unbroken phase above the critical radius , gauge fields and fermions are massless , \n whereas the higgs field remains massive .",

    "the acoustic sound dispersion of nitrogen in its liquid and supercritical phases has been studied by inelastic x - ray scattering . \n approaching supercritical conditions , the gradual disappearance of the positive sound dispersion , characteristic of the low temperature liquid , is observed . in the supercritical state , \n evidence for a crossover between adiabatic and isothermal sound propagation regimes is inferred by an analysis of the dynamic structure factor based on generalized hydrodynamics . \n the development of inelastic x - ray scattering ( @xmath0 ) @xcite has opened up new opportunities in the study of the high - frequency dynamics of liquids at nanometer distances and picosecond timescales . \n various @xmath1 investigations unveiled that , in the proper thermodynamical conditions , @xmath2 relaxation processes occur in the thz frequency range . \n these processes manifest themselves by an upward bending of the sound dispersion relation , which deviate from the low - frequency linear behavior dictated by the adiabatic sound velocity . \n accordingly , the sound velocity increases from the adiabatic value , @xmath3 , to the `` infinite '' frequency value , @xmath4 @xcite . \n if @xmath5 is the frequency of the probed acoustic excitation with wave vector @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the characteristic relaxation time of the structural relaxation process , the system exhibits a liquid - like ( @xmath8 ) behavior if the condition @xmath9 is fulfilled : in this limit the dispersion relation is @xmath10 . in the opposite limit , the @xmath11 one , where @xmath12 , structural rearrangements are too slow to efficiently dissipate the energy of the acoustic waves : in this limit @xmath13 . a schematic picture of this @xmath14 variation of the sound velocity form @xmath15 is shown in fig . \n 1a ( full thick line ) , where the cross -

over frequency given by @xmath25 . in this case , for @xmath26 the thermal diffusion is much slower than the period of acoustic waves , which therefore propagate adiabatically , i.e. without any thermal exchange with the local environment . in the opposite limit , @xmath27 , the thermalization of the acoustic wave is instantaneous , and the effective propagation mechanism becomes isothermal with sound velocity @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the specific heat ratio ) . \n one therefore expects to observe a transition between the adiabatic and the isothermal regimes when @xmath30 . \n this case is schematically presented in figure 1b , where linear lines represent the adiabatic ( full line ) and isothermal ( dotted line ) sound dispersion , and the dash - dot - dot line indicates the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath31 . \n contrary to the visco - elastic transition , which has been experimentally documented in many liquids @xcite , no firm evidence of the adiabatic to isothermal transition is available . \n this is mainly due to the following reasons : i ) the amplitude of the dispersive effect between @xmath32 and @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath34 which , in most liquids , is close to zero . \n ii ) the effect is often completely masked by the competing visco - elastic transition . \n iii ) the crossover occurs typically at large @xmath6 , often above the position of the first sharp diffraction peak ( fsdp ) of the static structure factor , @xmath35 . here \n , however , the finite-@xmath6 generalization of the isothermal sound speed @xmath36 - which is proportional to @xmath37 - @xcite , becomes too small to be reliably extracted from the measured @xmath38 spectra . \n these obstacles to the observation of the adiabatic to isothermal sound propagation transition can be reduced close to supercritical conditions for the following reasons : i ) the competing positive dispersion induced by the viscoelastic transition is expected to be much weaker . \n ii ) the crossover condition for the viscoelastic transition is expected to move at higher @xmath6 , i.e. higher frequency , since the structural rearrangements occur on shorter time scales . \n iii ) moreover , the intensity of the fsdp is much weaker , and consequently @xmath39 does not display any longer a pronounced minimum in the vicinity of the fsdp . \n iv ) finally , the sound speed decreases on approaching the critical point , and therefore the transition will move towards smaller @xmath6 values . \n this scenario is schematically pictured in figure 1c , where the combined effects of the structural and thermal relaxation processes are model within the framework of the molecular hydrodynamics @xcite . \n the values of @xmath7 and @xmath40 are chosen such that the transition is actually determined by the thermal relaxation process , as indicated by the arrow . \n this letter , guided by the above considerations , reports an ixs study of liquid and supercritical nitrogen . \n nitrogen has been chosen because the two thermodynamic regimes ( liquid and supercritical ) can be easily obtained within an experimentally accessible pressure and temperature range , and because of its favorable inelastic scattering cross section . \n figure 2 shows the portion of the explored thermodynamic plane . \n the inset reports the expected q -

width is given by @xmath57 . \n consequently the proposed model predicts the `` classical '' hydrodynamics description at low @xmath6 . \n the experimental data are described by the convolution of the model reported in eq.s [ sqw ] and [ memory ] with the experimentally determined instrument resolution function . in the fitting procedure , \n the parameters @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and an overall intensity factor @xmath61 are left as free parameters . \n owing to the lack of experimental or computational results on the @xmath6-dependence of @xmath29 and @xmath23 , these variables have been fixed to their thermodynamic ( @xmath62 ) values , as derived from the eos of nitrogen @xcite . \n the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 have been fixed to the values calculated through @xcite :    @xmath65^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the boltzmann constant and the molecular mass of nitrogen , respectively . \n the static structure factor s(q ) was determined experimentally by recording the energy - integrated scattering , corrected for the known nitrogen form factor , @xmath68 @xcite , as well as for all geometrical artifacts . in order to put @xmath35 on an absolute scale \n , we have normalized the measured intensity to fulfill the compressibility constraint in the @xmath69 limit . \n finally , the apparent sound velocity of acoustic excitations , @xmath70 , has been determined using the relation @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the frequency value of the maximum of the longitudinal current spectra , @xmath73 . \n selected ixs spectra and their best fits are shown in fig.3 . \n each spectrum typically covers an energy transfer range of @xmath74 mev and was collected in the 2 to 14 @xmath75 @xmath6 range . \n the logarithmic plot emphasizes the overall good agreement between experimental and model line shapes , even in the tails of the spectra . \n the comparisons between the apparent dispersion relation , @xmath72 @xmath76 @xmath6 ( open circles ) , and both isothermal ( dotted line ) and adiabatic ( full line ) ones , are shown in fig . 4 at the four different temperatures 87 , 128 , 171 , and 191 k. in the same figure we also report the infinite frequency dispersion relation ( full dots ) and the inverse of the structural relaxation time @xmath77 ( dashed - dot line ) as derived from the best fit result . \n the inverse of the thermal relaxation time , @xmath22 , is also reported as derived from the nitrogen eos ( dash - dot - dot line ) . \n the results of fig.4a , corresponding to the lowest investigated temperature ( 87 k ) , show that the apparent dispersion is systematically higher than the adiabatic one . \n although the @xmath4-limit is not completely reached , in this thermodynamic point the high frequency dynamics of the liquid is mostly influenced by the structural relaxation process . \n this influence is considerably weaker at @xmath78 k ( panel b ) due to the higher value of @xmath77 which prevents even - more to reach the viscoelastic crossover conditions . on further increase of the temperature \n ( panel c and d ) , @xmath77 moves definitely out of the probed frequency range and any hint of positive dispersion on the sound velocity disappears . \n in fact , with increasing temperature the apparent dispersion relation initially approaches the adiabatic sound dispersion , but at the highest temperature is observed to go below the adiabatic dispersion and to approach the isothermal one : this is the onset of the expected transition between adiabatic and isothermal regimes . \n this effect is most clearly seen for the three highest @xmath6 points between @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath75 . \n measurements , as discussed in the text ; the open circles indicate the maxima of longitudinal current spectra . \n the dash - dotted and dash - double dotted lines represent @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively ; the former has been evaluated interpolating the results of the performed lineshape analysis , which allowed also to extract the values of infinite - frequency sound dispersion , reported as full circles._,width=283 ]    the arrows in figure 4 ( panels c and d ) indicate the @xmath6 points where one would expect the adiabatic - isothermal transition ( @xmath83 , left arrows ) and where the transition actually occurs ( right arrows ) : a @xmath6 value definitively higher than the one estimated by the left arrow . \n this difference between expected and observed transition @xmath6 points is an indication of the @xmath6-dependence of the parameter @xmath23 , which we neglected so far . \n this behavior is in agreement with the expectations suggested by numerical simulations of various molecular liquids @xcite pointing to a monotonic decrease of @xmath84 with increasing @xmath6 . as a consequence \n , the position of the crossover is shifted towards higher momentum transfers . \n even though the transition to the isothermal regime is not fully completed , its occurrence is inferred from this systematic trend . \n furthermore , it is worthwhile recalling that the present results have been obtained without imposing any constraint on the line shape fitting parameters . \n moreover , the values of the isothermal sound dispersions have been determined independently through the measured @xmath35 .    in conclusion our observations \n can be summarized as follows : i ) the apparent sound branch of nitrogen show clear signatures of a positive sound dispersion in the liquid phase , thus witnessing the presence of a structural relaxation process . \n ii ) the positive sound dispersion gradually disappears while reaching supercritical conditions , most likely due to the shift of @xmath77 above the @xmath72 values . \n iii ) at the highest investigated temperatures , the transition from the adiabatic to the isothermal sound propagation is observed . \n these findings indicate that , in the liquid phase , the high frequency dynamic of a simple , non - associated fluid , such as nitrogen , is mainly ruled by the structural relaxation , as manifested by the positive sound dispersion . \n in contrast , in the supercritical phase , the role of the structural relaxation becomes negligible and the most evident dispersive effect is the bending down of the apparent dispersion , from its adiabatic value to the isothermal one . in this regime \n , the thermal relaxation process rules the high frequency dynamics .",

    "a common approach to study nucleation rates is the estimation of free - energy barriers . \n this usually requires knowledge about the shape of the forming droplet , a task that becomes notoriously difficult in macromolecular setups starting with a proper definition of the cluster boundary or a proper ensemble choice . here , we demonstrate that a shape - free determination of temperature - driven droplet formation is directly accessible in the canonical ensemble . combined with rigorous results on canonical equilibrium droplet formation , \n this allows for a well - defined finite - size scaling analysis of the effective interfacial free energy at fixed density . \n we verify the theoretical predictions for the formulation of a liquid droplet in a supersaturated gas by generalized - ensemble monte carlo simulations of a lennard - jones system . because a standard approach in monte carlo simulations is to work in the conformational ensemble , \n we show that excluding the kinetic energy from the partition function leads to finite - size differences in the free energy but retains intensive parameters in the thermodynamic limit . \n our study of nucleation rates at fixed density corresponds to a heating - cooling framework where simulation and experiment may meet at the nanometer scale . \n the formation of equilibrium droplets from a supersaturated gas is a long -

called phase - change materials  @xcite and glassy solids  @xcite . \n it is even connected to field theory  @xcite and nuclear reactions  @xcite . \n the formal framework of free - energy calculations is straightforward , e.g. , in terms of reaction coordinates in phase space , but the application in computer simulations is diverse with an ongoing demand for further methodological developments  @xcite . \n a seminal application was the parameter - free estimate of crystal nucleation rates from equilibrium free - energy barriers  @xcite . \n it seems natural that the estimation of nucleation barriers becomes increasingly difficult when considering more complex systems like polymer or protein solutions  @xcite . \n the rate of nucleation @xmath0 is related by classical nucleation theory  @xcite to the free -

size probability distribution  @xcite and is clearly temperature dependent  @xcite . \n this usually requires estimating the droplet size and interface , a task that introduces systematic uncertainties and strongly depends on the droplet definition . instead \n , the free - energy barrier may be directly related to the volume of the critical nucleus and the pressure difference  @xcite , exploiting a thorough understanding of the underlying phenomenon in a clever way . in this context \n , the problem can be reduced to conformational phase space , knowing that canonical expectation values typically do not depend on the kinetic energy .    in the following , \n we address the question of how to easily obtain dependable results on nucleation barriers without invoking elaborate thermodynamic reasoning or estimating nucleus shapes . \n this opens the door also to more complex systems with nucleation -

    "in human societies , people s willingness to compete and strive for better social status as well as being envious of those perceived in some way superior lead to social structures that are intrinsically hierarchical . here \n we propose an agent - based , network model to mimic the ranking behaviour of individuals and its possible repercussions in human society . \n the main ingredient of the model is the assumption that the relevant feature of social interactions is each individual s keenness to maximise his or her status relative to others . \n the social networks produced by the model are homophilous and assortative , as frequently observed in human communities and most of the network properties seem quite independent of its size . however , it is seen that for small number of agents the resulting network consists of disjoint weakly connected communities while being highly assortative and homophilic . on the other hand \n larger networks turn out to be more cohesive with larger communities but less homophilic . \n we find that the reason for these changes is that larger network size allows agents to use new strategies for maximizing their social status allowing for more diverse links between them . \n community formation , opinion formation , social hierarchy",

antibaryon production in @xmath0 annihilation , as shown in fig . \n [ ee - fig ] . \n we recall that the ratio of the cross sections for the corresponding @xmath14-channel processes @xmath15 should be infinite at zero momentum transfer , where the form factor simply measures the total proton and neutron charges , corresponding to a coherent sum over the electromagnetic charges of their constituent quarks . \n it is also believed that the ratio ( [ exptalratio ] ) should be large at high momentum transfers . in a naive perturbative description of @xmath0 annihilation into baryons , the virtual time - like \n photon first makes a ` primary ' @xmath16 pair , which is then dressed by two additional quark - antiquark pairs that pop out of the vacuum . \n this dressing is thought to be a perturbative qcd process at high momentum transfers , which does not distinguish between the @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks , since gluon couplings are flavor - blind . \n thus , in this conventional perturbative picture , the only difference between the production rates of proton and neutron is through the different electric charges of the primary @xmath16 pairs . \n the total perturbative cross section is obtained by superposing the amplitudes with different primary @xmath16 pairs and squaring the result : @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the amplitude at @xmath21 for making the baryon @xmath22 with a given primary flavor @xmath23 , which is determined by the baryon wave functions . \n since the wave functions of the baryon octet have a mixed symmetry , the amplitudes @xmath20 tend to be highly asymmetric in specific models . \n for example , in the chernyak -

statistics collider at slac for the regime @xmath33 gev @xcite . \n this machine will yield high - precision data on baryon production in @xmath32 annihilation at threshold , providing a check on the fenice data and an accurate benchmark for testing possible theoretical explanations . \n the first thing one must realize is that even though @xmath34 , the process is highly nonperturbative . \n this is because the ` extra ' kinetic energy available to the quarks is very small . \n our approach @xcite to this puzzle is based on thinking about the time - reversed processes : @xmath35 . \n these may be viewed as two - step processes , with a coherent meson state serving as an intermediate state , as shown schematically in fig . \n [ pions1-fig ] . \n one possible motivation for this picture might be provided by the skyrme model  @xcite , according to which baryons appear as solitons in a purely bosonic chiral lagrangian . \n this model is formally justified as a low - energy approximation to large-@xmath36 qcd  @xcite , and is known to provide a good description of many low - energy properties of baryons : see  @xcite for reviews . \n skyrmion - anti - skyrmion annihilation provides  @xcite-@xcite a fairly accurate description of low - energy baryon - antibaryon annihilation . just after the skyrmion and anti - skyrmion touch \n , they ` unravel ' each other , and a coherent classical pion wave emerges as a burst that takes away energy and baryon number as quickly as causality permits . \n a specific parametrization of the initial pion configuration is  @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the profile of the chiral field , @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 is a range parameter , @xmath41 is chosen so that the total energy is that of the @xmath11 pair , and the form of @xmath38 guarantees that the pion configuration has zero net baryon number . \n this crude model has been shown  @xcite to reproduce satisfactorily the inclusive single - pion spectrum in @xmath42 annihilation at rest and the branching ratios for multi - pion final states . \n the details of this specific configuration are unimportant for our purposes : what is important is that the data are not inconsistent with such a model . \n indeed , although the skyrme model provides some motivation for our approach , it is not even essential for our purpose . \n what is important is that _ a single intermediate state should dominate _ the two - step @xmath35 process . \n this could , for example , equally well be a single intermediate @xmath43 resonant meson state .    to be more precise , \n since @xmath11 annihilation is a strong - interaction process , one must consider separately the @xmath44 and @xmath45 channels . \n accurately stated , our key assumption is that both of these channels are dominated by single states . \n these might be some excited @xmath46 and @xmath47 mesons , for example , just as well as coherent pion configurations ( [ amado ] ) with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    with this picture in mind \n , we write the @xmath48 @xmath35 annihilation amplitudes as @xmath49 , where the overall phase is irrelevant , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are relatively real , and @xmath52 is the relative phase between the @xmath44 and @xmath45 amplitudes . \n we then have @xmath53 it is apparent from ( [ ratio ] ) that @xmath54 if either @xmath55 or _ \n vice versa_.    remarkably , _ there is evidence from both @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilations that @xmath57 final states dominate by large factors_.    the clearest evidence comes from @xmath58 , where it is found by measuring final states with even and odd numbers of pions respectively that @xmath59 as seen in fig .

violating final states , but we are unaware of a comparable analysis of multi - pion final states . because the initial state is a mixture with different @xmath72 , it is not possible to separate @xmath44 from @xmath45 simply by counting pions , as was the case in @xmath56 annihilation . \n the most convincing experimental information known to us comes from an analysis of @xmath73 . by comparing the rates for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , it has been possible to extract  @xcite @xmath76 which is comparable to the corresponding ratio ( [ eeratio ] ) in @xmath77 annihilation \n the fact that @xmath44 dominates over @xmath45 in the ratio ( [ nnbarratio ] ) is consistent with the hypothesis that most of the @xmath78 final states are created by @xmath79 and @xmath80 pairs in the initial @xmath67 state , with a @xmath64 pair popping out of the vacuum . \n the ratio ( [ nnbarratio ] ) would be small if primary @xmath64 pairs dominated . \n we now use the experimental information on the dominance by the @xmath44 channel in both @xmath56 ( [ eeratio ] ) and @xmath70s / d@xmath71 annihilation ( [ nnbarratio ] ) in a quantitative analysis of the @xmath81 production @xmath82 ratio ( [ ratio ] ) . defining @xmath83 , \n we can rewrite ( [ ratio ] ) as @xmath84 it is clear that the zero - momentum - transfer limit @xmath85 is obtained in the limit @xmath86 , and that the high - momentum - transfer limit @xmath87 is obtained in the limit @xmath88 . in order to estimate @xmath89 , our assumption of dominance in each isospin channel by a single state ( either a coherent multi - pion state ( [ amado ] ) or a generalized vector meson @xmath90 ) tells us that @xmath91 inserting the experimental indications ( [ eeratio],[nnbarratio ] ) into ( [ factorization ] ) , we estimate that @xmath92 the top end of this range seems to us quite conservative , whereas the lower end surely requires more justification from @xmath11 annihilation data . in the following numerical analysis \n , we keep @xmath93 general , but focus extra attention on the limits @xmath94 and @xmath95 . \n it is apparent from ( [ newratio ] ) that @xmath96 is possible for any value of @xmath93 , for a restricted range of the relative phase @xmath97 . \n however , the allowed range of @xmath52 is extended if @xmath93 is small . \n it is easy to see that @xmath82 lies in a narrow range @xmath98 around unity if @xmath52 falls within the following range : @xmath99 it is apparent that @xmath96 for all values of @xmath52 if @xmath93 is small , as suggested ( [ epsilon ] ) by the available data on @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilation . \n the quantitative behaviour of @xmath82 as a function of @xmath100 and @xmath101 is shown in fig . \n [ fig : threed ] . displayed explicitly is the region of the @xmath102 plane where @xmath82 falls within the experimental range ( [ exptalratio ] ) . \n we see that this range favours @xmath103 , whatever the value of @xmath93 . \n fig . \n [ fig : twod ] displays projections of fig . \n [ fig : threed ] for the two limiting values @xmath94 and @xmath95 . the allowed range ( [ exptalratio ] ) of @xmath82 and the corresponding ranges of @xmath52 \n are also shown . \n we conclude that the _ a priori _ puzzling large experimental value of the ratio @xmath104 can be understood qualitatively . \n this is relatively easy if the @xmath105 amplitude dominates over the @xmath45 amplitude , as suggested by the available data on @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilation and our assumption of dominance by a single coherent state in each isospin channel . \n the specific range ( [ exptalratio ] ) can be understood quantitatively if the @xmath44 and @xmath45 amplitude have a large relative phase @xmath52 . \n we are not in a position to judge the plausibility of such a large value of @xmath52 , from either an experimental or a theoretical point of view . \n it would be interesting to make tests of this possibility . \n the disagreement between the naive theoretical prediction and experiment is striking again . \n we comment finally on the surprisingly large value of the ratio @xmath106 observed by the cleo collaboration @xcite ( see also @xcite-@xcite for related experimental work ) .    as shown in fig . \n [ cleo - gg - fig ] , cleo find that close to threshold , which seems analogous to fenice result for the @xmath107 ratio .    as illustrated by fig . \n [ gg - fig ] , for a given quark flavor , the perturbative amplitude for baryon - antibaryon production in the photon - photon reaction scales like the quark charge squared , compared with the linear dependence of the amplitudes on the quark charge in the @xmath0 case discussed earlier . \n thus one might naively expect the ratio @xmath108 to be even smaller than the corresponding perturbative prediction for @xmath109 in @xmath0 \n .    it would be interesting to approach this puzzle from a point of view similar to that adopted in this paper . \n however , the situation in @xmath110 collisions is more complicated , because of the wider range of possible spin and isospin states . also , the information available on the isospin and spin decomposition is sparse compared with that in @xmath0 annihilation , which we used above . \n data for @xmath111 close to threshold might cast light on the @xmath112 puzzle , but are not yet available .    in ref . \n @xcite we have proposed a simple model that is able to accommodate the surprisingly large observed value of the ratio @xmath113 . \n our suggestion is based on a simple two - step approach , in which a single intermediate state with @xmath44 dominates over @xmath45 . \n this dominant intermediate state could be motivated by a skyrmion - anti - skyrmion picture , or could be some excited @xmath46 resonance . \n our model could be tested by further measurements of the ratios of different isospin amplitudes in @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilation , and suggests a relatively large phase difference between @xmath44 and @xmath45 amplitudes . \n we look forward to more experimental data bearing on these issues , for example from a new low - energy @xmath56 collider  @xcite .",

    "we report on optical orientation of mn@xmath0 ions in bulk gaas under application of weak longitudinal magnetic fields ( @xmath1  mt ) . \n a manganese spin polarization of 25% is directly evaluated using spin - flip raman scattering . \n the dynamical mn@xmath0 polarization occurs due to the s - d exchange interaction with optically oriented conduction band electrons . \n time - resolved photoluminescence reveals a nontrivial electron spin dynamics , where the oriented mn@xmath0 ions tend to stabilize the electron spin . \n electron spin interactions in semiconductors are in the focus of current attention as they are of interest for various applications in electronics and quantum information . \n a pathway to spin manipulation is to implement magnetic ions in semiconductors and exploit the strong exchange interaction between an electron ( hole ) and a magnetic ion ( for example mn ) . \n a spectacular example to that end is a quantum dot ( qd ) with a single mn ion @xcite . \n another model realization has been achieved for gaas doped with mn acceptors of low concentration , where a photoexcited electron is localized on a residual donor in vicinity of a mn acceptor @xcite . \n optical orientation of manganese acceptors and their spin control are attractive for investigation of various nontrivial scenarios of electron spin dynamics in semiconductors , e.g. multi - exponential spin decay or spin precession in effective exchange fields . \n optical orientation of a single mn@xmath0 ion in a ii - vi qd has been recently reported @xcite . \n however , the question whether this is feasible in iii - v materials , such as gaas , has remained open @xcite . \n here we report on the direct observation of optical spin orientation of mn@xmath0 ions in bulk gaas under optical illumination with circular polarized light in longitudinal magnetic fields ( faraday geometry ) . in spin - flip raman scattering ( sfrs ) \n we observe spectral lines corresponding to spin - flip processes of the ionized mn acceptor . \n the asymmetry of stokes and anti - stokes ( sas ) line intensities under circular polarized excitation opens a way for direct evaluation of the manganese spin polarization , which can reach 25% . \n time - resolved photoluminescence ( trpl ) reveals a nontrivial electron spin dynamics resulting from the stabilizing feedback of the oriented manganese on the electron spin . \n the results of sfrs and trpl agree well , supporting clearly optical manganese orientation in weak magnetic fields . \n we investigate bulk gaas doped with mn acceptors with a concentration of 8@xmath2  @xmath3 @xcite . \n the acceptors are partially compensated by residual shallow donors with a concentration of about @xmath4  @xmath3 @xcite . \n this results in ionization of the acceptors located in the vicinity of donors if not illuminated by light . \n detailed descriptions of the experimental techniques can be found in ref . \n @xcite for sfrs and in ref . \n @xcite for trpl .    in order to detect manganese polarization \n we exploit sfrs technique , which selectively monitors the changes of mn@xmath0 spin projection by @xmath5 with mn spin @xmath6 . \n it enables to measure both the zeeman splitting @xmath7 and the amplitudes of sas components . here \n @xmath8 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath9 is the mn - lande factor . \n the ratio between the stokes and anti - stokes line intensities , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively is given not only by the selection rules but also by the mn@xmath0 spin polarization @xmath12 . \n it can be shown that in faraday geometry for circular co - polarized excitation and detection with helicity @xmath13 and for a small manganese polarization ( @xmath14 ) the sas asymmetry parameter of sfrs , @xmath15 is independent on the specific mn spin - flip mechanism . in this case \n @xmath16 directly monitors the spin polarization of manganese . in eq . \n ( [ eq : sfrsasymmetry ] ) we assumed : ( i ) the spectral width of the spin - flip resonance profile is larger than the zeeman spin splitting ; ( ii ) raman scattering without conservation of the total angular momentum of manganese and the exciton in the intermediate state is possible . \n such transitions are allowed in presence of anisotropic exchange interaction between the exciton and the manganese @xmath17 electrons , i.e. if the symmetry of the system is reduced @xcite . \n the manganese polarization @xmath18 depends not only on the external magnetic field due to the thermal population of the zeeman sublevels , but also on the non - equilibrium electron polarization @xmath19 due to the dynamical polarization of mn spins by electrons ( holes are not oriented in bulk gaas @xcite ) . \n this process is similar to dynamical polarization of the nuclei in semiconductors ( overhauser effect ) and has been considered for ii - vi diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite . \n the dynamical polarization changes sign if the helicity of circular polarized excitation , @xmath20 or @xmath21 , is reversed . \n therefore , it is necessary to measure the two asymmetry parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the two polarizations . \n figure [ fig : sfrspectra](a ) shows sfrs spectra for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 excitation / detection polarizations in a magnetic field of 2  t. two pairs of lines corresponding to transitions where the angular momentum changes by @xmath26 are detected . \n their magnetic field dependence of the raman shift follows the expected linear dependence , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 [ see inset in fig . \n [ fig : sfrspectra](a ) ] , corresponding therefore to spin - flip transitions between the zeeman sublevels of the mn@xmath0 ions , i.e. the ionized manganese acceptors @xmath29 @xcite . \n the magnetic field dependence of the sas asymmetry parameter @xmath16 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 excitation and @xmath26 is shown in fig . \n [ fig : sfrspectra](b ) . \n the @xmath16 increase with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and they also depend on the helicity of laser excitation , from which we can conclude that optical orientation of manganese has been accomplished . using eq . \n ( [ eq : sfrsasymmetry ] ) we deduce the dependence of the manganese polarization @xmath12 on magnetic field for @xmath20 and @xmath21 excitation . \n the difference between the two polarizations allows us to estimate the contribution of the optical orientation to the manganese polarization @xmath32/2 \n \\approx -0.25 $ ] , independent of magnetic field for @xmath33  t [ see fig . \n [ fig : sfrspectra](c ) ] . \n the other contribution to @xmath12 , related to the thermal population of the zeeman sublevels @xmath34/2 $ ] , grows with field and is comparable with @xmath35 at @xmath36  t. the spin - flip resonance profile has a maximum at about 1.513  ev , which corresponds to resonant excitation of the exciton bound to the charged donor @xmath37 @xcite . \n moreover , the most intensive signals appear for pump density around 50  w/@xmath38 . \n the decrease of the spin - flip scattering intensity at higher pump densities is related with neutralization of ionized acceptors after capture of photoexcited holes @xcite . \n = 7.5 cm    the resulting mn@xmath0 polarization in longitudinal magnetic field is given by a dynamical equation analogous to the overhauser effect @xcite @xmath39 \\nonumber \\\\ -\\frac{1}{t_l}(p_m - p_t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term on the right side describes the dynamical polarization of manganese with time @xmath40 via electrons with polarization @xmath19 . \n the second term reflects the spin relaxation to the equilibrium value @xmath41 with time @xmath42 . here \n @xmath43 is the temperature and @xmath44 is the boltzmann constant . \n the equilibrium electron polarization @xmath45 is much smaller than @xmath46 since spin @xmath47 and lande factor @xmath48 of the electron are significantly smaller than those for mn@xmath0 . \n the steady state solution of eq . \n ( [ eq : ratemnpola ] ) neglecting @xmath49 gives @xmath50 here the first term corresponds to the equilibrium orientation resulting from thermalization on the zeeman sublevels ( i.e. @xmath51 ) , while the second term is the dynamical polarization @xmath35 by electrons . \n the electron polarization is determined by the laser helicity . \n a polarization @xmath52 was directly measured by optical orientation at the band edge under the same experimental conditions . \n therefore , eq .  ( [ eq : mnpola ] ) can be used for evaluating the time ratio @xmath53 and the actual temperature @xmath43 in the region of illumination . using the experimental value @xmath54 \n we obtain @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( for @xmath57  t ) . \n this corresponds to @xmath58  k , i.e. the real temperature under illumination is increased by 2 k. the same value for @xmath43 follows from the magnetic field dependence of @xmath59 when fitted with a brillouin function , see fig . \n [ fig : sfrspectra](c ) . \n electron spin - flip scattering with mn@xmath0 ions should also manifest itself in the dynamics of the average electron spin . indeed , since the mn polarization will be transferred back into the electron spin - system , the average electron spin should contain information about the mn polarization . in absence of other relaxation channels the dynamics of electron polarization is given by an expression similar to the @xmath40-term in eq . \n ( [ eq : ratemnpola ] ) @xmath60,\\ ] ] since it reflects the conservation of total spin in the flip - flop process . \n the electron spin relaxation time @xmath61 depends on the mn@xmath0 concentration @xmath62 and time @xmath40 through @xmath63 . for small photoelectron concentrations @xmath64 \n the electron spin relaxation time is much shorter than that of manganese , i.e. @xmath65 ( a similar relation holds for the electron - nuclear system ) . from trpl @xmath66  ns and , therefore \n , one can estimate @xmath67s for @xmath68  @xmath3 , and @xmath69  @xmath3 . under pulsed photoexcitation with repetition period @xmath70 ( which satisfies the condition @xmath71 ) , \n the manganese spin polarization is gradually accumulated and shows no change within time @xmath70 . \n therefore , in weak magnetic fields ( @xmath72 ) the solution of eq . \n ( [ eq : rateelectrpola ] ) in a time domain @xmath70 can be written as @xmath73 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_s}\\right).\\ ] ] at the moment of pulsed excitation @xmath74 the maximum possible electron polarization @xmath75 is generated @xcite . \n subsequently it decays with a characteristic time @xmath61 until it reaches the plateau , which corresponds to the steady state non - equilibrium manganese polarization . \n the plateau results from the spin back flow from manganese to the electrons , providing a long - lived electron spin memory . \n in previous trpl measurements in weak longitudinal magnetic fields we already observed a slow spin relaxation dynamics ( up to @xmath76s ) of electrons localized on shallow donors in gaas : mn @xcite . \n however , the small signal - to - noise ratio in these studies did not allow us to draw an unambiguous conclusion on the non - exponential spin evolution . \n large power densities induce undesired local heating . \n therefore , we increased the setup sensitivity by enlarging the illumination area by a factor of 400 , while keeping the pulse energy density low at @xmath77  nj/@xmath38 . \n the intensity transient of the donor - acceptor ( @xmath78 ) pl line is shown in fig .  [ \n fig : tprlplateau](a ) , showing a decay with 100  ns lifetime . \n the decay of circular polarization degree @xmath79 gives direct access to the spin dynamics of the oriented electrons . \n figure  [ fig : tprlplateau](b ) shows a nontrivial electron spin dynamics @xcite . \n we find an initial electron spin @xmath80 , which is close to the maximum value of 0.5 . \n after decay within several tens of ns the electron spin polarization reaches a plateau , whose level increases with magnetic field and reaches 0.35 for @xmath81  mt . \n using eq . \n ( [ eq : epola ] ) we determine the magnetic field dependencies of @xmath61 and @xmath12 , as presented in fig . \n [ fig : tprlplateau](c ) . \n the electron spin relaxation time increases from 20 to 100  ns in a magnetic field of 150  mt . the plateau values corresponding to @xmath12 are symmetric with respect to magnetic field inversion and they change sign if the excitation helicity sign is reversed ( i.e. , they follow the electron spin polarization ) . \n this corroborates our conclusion about optical orientation of manganese . \n the manganese orientation is absent in zero magnetic field , in accord with @xcite , however , it appears in weak magnetic fields and saturates for @xmath82  mt in line with the @xmath35 behavior from sfrs , see fig . \n [ fig : sfrspectra](c ) . \n we can exclude any influence of dynamical polarization of lattice nuclei since nuclear polarization should appear in much smaller magnetic fields @xmath83  mt , where @xmath84 is the local field onto a nucleus by the neighboring nuclei @xcite . moreover , we do not observe any plateau in p - gaas samples doped with non - magnetic ge acceptors @xcite . \n thus , the plateau evidences manganese dynamic polarization in weak longitudinal magnetic fields , which suppress mn@xmath0 spin relaxation . \n = 8.2 cm    above we discussed the spin transfer between the localized electrons and the mn@xmath0 ions . \n this transfer occurs due to fluctuations of the exchange interaction given by the hamiltonian @xmath85 . here \n @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the electron and manganese spin operators , respectively , and @xmath88 is a constant depending on the electron probability at the mn@xmath0 site . \n apart from the fluctuation term the exchange interaction in mean - field approximation contains an expression like @xmath89 , where the exchange constant @xmath90 is the average electron probability at the mn@xmath0 site and @xmath91 is the donor filling factor . \n the first term describes the interaction of the electron spin with the effective exchange field of manganese @xmath92 ( analogue of the overhauser field ) . \n the second term corresponds to interaction of manganese spins with the effective field of the electrons @xmath93 ( analogue of the knight field ) . for small excitation densities @xmath94 , and as a result @xmath95 . \n = 6 cm    the presence of the exchange manganese field can be detected via changes in the electron larmor precession frequency in an external magnetic field . since manganese polarization is absent in voigt geometry @xcite it is necessary to perform this experiment in oblique magnetic field for @xmath20 and @xmath21 polarized excitation . \n these data are summarized in fig . \n [ fig : obliqueb ] . figure  [ fig : obliqueb](a ) shows the oscillations of the circular polarization degree of the pl in time for the two opposite helicities ( @xmath96  mt applied at an angle @xmath97 with respect to the light propagation direction ) . \n indeed we see that the larmor frequencies @xmath98 corresponding to electron spin precession with @xmath48 are different ( @xmath99  ns@xmath100 ) . \n based on this difference we can plot the dependence of the effective magnetic field @xmath101 on external magnetic field @xmath31 , as shown in fig .  [ \n fig : obliqueb](b ) . \n the clear correlation between the magnetic field dependencies of @xmath102 and the plateau value @xmath103 indicates their common origin : both are proportional to the non - equilibrium manganese polarization @xmath12 . \n one can also estimate the exchange constant @xmath90 . \n we note that in oblique magnetic fields no oscillations with the mn@xmath0 @xmath104 factor are observed . \n this indicates that the manganese orientation is parallel to the direction of the external magnetic field @xmath105 , i.e. effective optical pumping occurs only for the spin component along @xmath105 . \n therefore , the polarization @xmath106 . then in the oblique geometry the field @xmath107 . simultaneously from eq . \n ( [ eq : epola ] ) we have for the plateau @xmath108 . the ratio of @xmath109 from fig . \n [ fig : obliqueb](b ) allows one to derive @xmath110ev . \n this is in agreement with the value of @xmath111ev for mn@xmath0 in the center of the donor , giving an upper limit for @xmath90 @xcite .    in conclusion \n , we have demonstrated optical orientation of mn@xmath0 acceptors in gaas using two optical techniques . \n dynamic manganese polarization is established in weak longitudinal magnetic fields ( @xmath1  mt ) , which are required to suppress the mn@xmath0 spin relaxation . \n the optically oriented mn@xmath0 ions maintain the spin and return part of the polarization back to the electron spin system providing a long - lived electron spin memory . \n the authors are grateful to k.  v.  kavokin for useful discussions . \n this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( grant no . \n 436rus@xmath1120 - 1 ) and the russian foundation for basic research .",

    "spectral algorithms based on matrix representations of networks are often used to detect communities but classic spectral methods based on the adjacency matrix and its variants fail to detect communities in sparse networks . \n new spectral methods based on non - backtracking random walks have recently been introduced that successfully detect communities in many sparse networks . \n however , the spectrum of non - backtracking random walks ignores hanging trees in networks that can contain information about the community structure of networks . \n we introduce the reluctant backtracking operators that explicitly account for hanging trees as they admit a small probability of returning to the immediately previous node unlike the non - backtracking operators that forbid an immediate return . \n we show that the reluctant backtracking operators can detect communities in certain sparse networks where the non - backtracking operators can not while performing comparably on benchmark stochastic block model networks and real world networks . \n we also show that the spectrum of the reluctant backtracking operator approximately optimises the standard modularity function similar to the flow matrix . \n interestingly , for this family of non- and reluctant - backtracking operators the main determinant of performance on real - world networks is whether or not they are normalised to conserve probability at each node . \n many networks have a modular structure . \n social networks contain communities of friends @xcite , collaborators @xcite , and dolphins @xcite ; brain networks contain groups of correlated neurons @xcite , circuits of connected groups @xcite , and regions of connected circuits @xcite . \n similarly modular networks occur across biological domains from protein interaction networks to food webs @xcite . \n this range of applications has driven the dramatic development of  community detection \" methods for solving the core problem of finding modules within an arbitrary network @xcite . especially popular are spectral methods based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of some matrix representation of the network . \n these combine speed of execution with considerable information about the network beyond the modular structure @xcite , including the relative roles of each node @xcite and characterisation of the network s dynamical properties @xcite . \n spectral methods can fail for a range of real networks . \n these methods rely on the eigenvalues falling into two classes , the vast majority  the  bulk \"  following a well - defined distribution , and the outliers from that distribution giving information about the modular structure . \n topological features of a network unrelated to its modules , such as network hub nodes with high degree , can distort this distinction by introducing eigenvalues outside the bulk that mix with those containing information about modules@xcite . \n sparse networks often contain such network hubs and the outlying uninformative eigenvalues cause the breakdown of spectral methods @xcite . \n unfortunately many real - world networks are sparse ( see table ii in @xcite and table 1 in @xcite ) . \n krzakala et al . \n @xcite proposed a new  non - backtracking \" matrix representation of a network that solves this problem : their matrix represents a random walker on the network who can not immediately return to a node it has just left . \n the eigenspectrum of the adjacency and related matrices is closely related to properties of a random walker traversing a network . \n in particular , the eigenspectrum depends on the frequency with which the walker passes through any given node . \n as the non - backtracking matrix forbids the random walker to return to its immediately previous node , network hubs are not visited disproportionately by this random walker and the spectrum of this random walker is not distorted by the presence of hubs in the network . following this \n , newman introduced the closely - related  flow \" matrix @xcite that conserved the probability for the random walk . \n spectral methods applied to these matrices successfully recover modules in sparse networks , down to the theoretical limit for their detection in classes of model networks @xcite . \n however , as noted by newman @xcite , these represent an incomplete solution as networks containing trees can not be handled elegantly . \n because the random walker could not escape from such a tree once entered , trees are ignored despite being candidates for separate modules . in this paper \n we introduce the  reluctant backtracker \" approach , which combines the advantages of these new matrix representations by retaining the power of spectral methods for sparse networks with the ability to detect and correctly handle networks with trees . \n we show that this comes with no penalty for detection performance compared to non - backtracking and flow matrices . \n rather , we show that the main difference in performance depends on whether or not such matrix representations are normalised to conserve probability . \n this finding hints at some deeper difference in network structure than modularity alone . \n we first outline the non - backtracking @xcite and flow matrix @xcite approaches . \n both these approaches and ours start from the same representation of the network . \n assume an unweighted undirected connected network with @xmath0 vertices and @xmath1 edges without self loops . \n we convert the undirected network into a directed network with @xmath2 edges by replacing the undirected edge with directed edges in both directions ;

    "in the galactic microquasars with double peak khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) , the ratio of the two frequencies is 3:2 . \n this supports the suggestion that double peak khz qpos are due to a non - linear resonance between two modes of accretion disk oscillations . for the microquasars with known mass \n , we briefly compare the black hole spin estimates based on the orbital resonance model with the recently reported spin predictions obtained by fitting the spectral continua . \n results of these two approaches are not in good agreement . \n we stress that if the spectral fit estimates are accurate and can be taken as referential ( which is still questionable ) , the disagreement between the predicted and referential values would represent a rather generic problem for any relativistic qpo model , as no spin influence would appear in the observed @xmath0 scaling of the qpo frequencies . the epicyclic frequencies relevant in these models are often considered to be equal to those of a test particle motion . \n however modifications of the frequencies due to the disc pressure or other non - geodesic effects may play an important role , and the inaccuracy introduced in the spin estimates by the test particle approximation could be crucial .",

    "we present a new possibility for the active frequency stabilization of a laser using transitions in neutral praseodymium . because of its five outer electrons , this element shows a high density of energy levels leading to an extremely line - rich excitation spectrum with more than known spectral lines ranging from the uv to the infrared . \n we demonstrate the active frequency stabilization of a diode laser on several praseodymium lines between 1105 and 1123  nm . \n the excitation signals were recorded in a hollow cathode lamp and observed via laser - induced fluorescence . \n these signals are strong enough to lock the diode laser onto most of the lines by using standard laser locking techniques . in this way , the frequency drifts of the unlocked laser of more than 30  mhz / h were eliminated and the laser frequency stabilized to within 1.4(1 )  mhz for averaging times @xmath0  s. frequency quadrupling the stabilized diode laser can produce in the range from 276  to  281  nm . in particular , using a strong hyperfine component of the praseodymium excitation line  at  makes it possible - after frequency quadruplication - to produce laser radiation at , which can be used to excite the d@xmath1  line in mg@xmath2 .",

    "the linear model , in which a set of observations is assumed to be given by a linear combination of columns of a matrix ( often termed a dictionary ) , has long been the mainstay of the statistics and signal processing literature . \n one particular challenge for inference under linear models is understanding the conditions on the dictionary under which reliable inference is possible . \n this challenge has attracted renewed attention in recent years since many modern inference problems ( e.g. , high - dimensional statistics , compressed sensing ) deal with the `` underdetermined '' setting , in which the number of observations is much smaller than the number of columns in the dictionary . \n this paper makes several contributions for this setting when the set of observations is given by a linear combination of a small number of _ groups of columns _ of the dictionary , termed the `` block - sparse '' case . \n first , it specifies conditions on the dictionary under which most block submatrices of the dictionary ( often termed block subdictionaries ) are well conditioned . \n this result is fundamentally different from prior work on block - sparse inference because ( @xmath0 ) it provides conditions that can be explicitly computed in polynomial time , ( @xmath1 ) the given conditions translate into near - optimal scaling of the number of columns of the block subdictionaries as a function of the number of observations for a large class of dictionaries , and ( @xmath2 ) it suggests that the spectral norm , rather than the column / block coherences , of the dictionary fundamentally limits the scaling of dimensions of the well - conditioned block subdictionaries . \n second , in order to help understand the significance of this result in the context of block - sparse inference , this paper investigates the problems of block - sparse recovery and block - sparse regression in underdetermined settings . in both of these problems , \n this paper utilizes its result concerning conditioning of block subdictionaries and establishes that near - optimal block - sparse recovery and block - sparse regression is possible for a large class of dictionaries as long as the dictionary satisfies easily computable conditions and the coefficients describing the linear combination of groups of columns can be modeled through a mild statistical prior . \n third , the paper reports extensive numerical experiments that highlight the effects of different measures of the dictionary in block - sparse inference problems . \n block - sparse inference , block - sparse recovery , block - sparse regression , compressed sensing , group lasso , group sparsity , high - dimensional statistics , multiple measurement vectors , random block subdictionaries",

    "a lattice of optical ring resonators can exhibit a topological insulator phase , with the role of spin played by the direction of propagation of light within each ring . unlike the system studied by hafezi _ \n et al . _ \n @xcite , topological protection is achieved without fine - tuning the inter - resonator couplings , which are given the same periodicity as the underlying lattice . \n the topological insulator phase occurs for strong couplings , when the tight - binding method is inapplicable . using the transfer matrix method \n , we derive the bandstructure and phase diagram , and demonstrate the existence of robust edge states . \n when gain and loss are introduced , the system functions as a diode for coupled resonator modes . \n the idea that photonic modes can have non - trivial topological properties , like topological states of quantum matter , originated with haldane and raghu @xcite , who predicted that a two - dimensional ( 2d ) photonic crystal with broken time - reversal symmetry can support modes analogous to those of a `` zero - field '' quantum hall gas @xcite . \n this has been confirmed experimentally , using gyromagnetic photonic crystals operating at microwave frequencies @xcite . \n that system s most striking feature is the existence of topologically protected one - way photonic edge states , which could be used for on - chip isolation @xcite . \n however , this is difficult to realize at optical frequencies , where magneto - optic effects are weak . \n different systems supporting topological photonic modes have subsequently been proposed @xcite . \n in particular , hafezi _ et al . _ \n @xcite studied a lattice of ring resonators , similar to a 2d version of the crow ( coupled resonator optical waveguide ) @xcite , in which the direction of propagation of light within each resonator acts as a two - fold `` spin '' degree of freedom . in the tight - binding ( weak - coupling ) regime , coupling waveguides can be used to implement spin - conserving hopping between adjacent resonator modes , and phase shifts in these couplers give rise to an effective vector potential in the tight - binding hopping amplitudes , with opposite signs for the two spins . with a choice of phase shifts implementing the landau gauge ( which is aperiodic in the lattice ) , the effective magnetic field can be made uniform and non - zero , which yields a photonic analog of the integer quantum hall effect in each spin sector , with a hofstadter butterfly spectrum @xcite and topologically protected edge states . \n although the system is reciprocal ( time - reversal maps the two spin sectors onto each other ) , and thus can not be used as a conventional optical isolator , hafezi _ et al . \n _  suggested that the edge states can serve as robust optical delay lines @xcite . \n the spin - dependent magnetic field in this system is reminiscent of the topological insulator model of kane and mele @xcite , which has attracted major theoretical and experimental interest @xcite . \n however , there is one major difference : the couplings in the kane - mele model have the periodicity of the lattice , and decoupling the two spin sectors reduces the model to two zero - field quantum hall systems @xcite , with zero net magnetic flux through each unit cell . in the system of hafezi _ et al . \n _ , the couplings are aperiodic and decoupled spin sectors act as _ integer _ quantum hall systems ; the tight - binding analysis seemed to imply that the periodic , zero - field system is topologically trivial @xcite . \n aperiodic couplings also impose a practical design challenge , since a variety of different couplers must be used .    in this letter \n , we show that the zero - field resonator lattice supports a topological insulator phase . \n when the inter - resonator couplings are tuned to large values beyond the tight - binding regime , the system exhibits one - way edge states , with non - zero @xmath0 topological invariant @xcite ; if the two spin sectors are decoupled , each acts as a zero - field system , like the kane - mele model @xcite . \n the system therefore behaves as a photonic topological insulator . \n previously , khanikaev _ et al . _ \n @xcite have proposed a different photonic topological insulator , which also does not require aperiodic couplings , using linear combinations of polarization states as the spin analog . however , that system relies on the special properties of metamaterials , whereas the present one uses ordinary dielectric materials and is thus considerably more feasible . \n our calculations rely on the transfer matrix method , which has previously been applied to the crow @xcite , and has a wider domain of validity for such systems than the tight - binding method @xcite . \n this method also lets us easily study the effects of gain and loss , which can produce behaviors not easily obtainable in electronic topological insulators . \n we focus on the pt ( parity / time - reversal ) symmetric lattice @xcite , which contains balanced amounts of gain and loss . \n theoretical and experimental studies have shown that pt - symmetric lattices possess unusual properties , including bifurcations between real and complex bands @xcite . \n we show that in a pt - symmetric photonic topological insulator , one edge state can be amplified while the back - propagating state of the same spin , on the opposite edge , is damped . \n the lattice thus acts as a robust optical diode for crow modes . \n the resonator lattice is shown schematically in fig . \n [ fig : couplings ] . \n a ring resonator occupies each site of a square lattice . \n its modes have a two - fold `` spin '' corresponding to the propagation direction within the ring . as proposed in ref . \n @xcite and depicted in fig .

0 cylinder , one set of edges of each hexagon lies along the x direction , and there are eight sites along the zigzag columns , which are connected periodically . \n so , the circumference is @xmath18 lattice spacings . for the yc4 - 0 cylinder , \n one set of edges of each hexagon lies along the y direction and the cylinder is connected periodically along the y direction with circumference @xmath19 lattice spacings . for the xc9 - 1 cylinder , the connection has a horizontal shift of one zigzag column , producing a circumference of @xmath20 .    in fig . \n [ phase](c ) , we present the ground state of a single system which gives an overview of the entire phase diagram . for this long yc6 - 0 cylinder , @xmath2 is uniform along the vertical direction , but varies linearly with the horizontal position from @xmath21 at the left edge to @xmath22 at the right edge . to make the af order visible \n , we apply a staggered field at the left end of the cylinder . \n as @xmath2 increases along the cylinder , the af order decreases , becoming negligible in the intermediate phase . \n we will discuss this intermediate state in detail below . \n the svbc phase appears clearly for @xmath6 . \n this svbc phase has strong first - neighbor correlations along the vertical direction with strong horizontal second - neighbor correlations connecting them to form `` ladders '' . \n below we will determine the phase boundaries of the af and svbc phases more accurately . \n first , we estimate the boundary of the af phase . \n one technique to determine magnetic order parameters using dmrg is to put strong ordering fields on the edges of an open cylinder , and to adjust the aspect ratio @xmath23 to to minimize the finite - size effects @xcite . for both square and triangular spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnets , an aspect ratio near @xmath24 \n is found to minimize the finite - size effects . for xcm-0 cylinders with m columns , the aspect ratio is @xmath25 , which we use . for @xmath21 , we determine that @xmath26 , which is close to the value determined using monte carlo calculations in the thermodynamic limit @xmath27 @xcite . with @xmath2 increasing , \n we find that the magnetization reduces to near zero for @xmath28 in fig . \n [ mag ] . \n the various cluster sizes all point to the phase transition near 0.26 . \n this phase transition point is larger than the classical limit value of @xmath29 . \n reference @xcite claims that the neel order disappears at 0.08 ; however , the value we find here is more consistent with other studies which give @xmath30 @xcite .     for various xc cylinders . \n the inset shows how the local magnetization decays from the edge of a long xc10 cylinder for various values of @xmath2.,width=226 ]     for different xc cylinders near the transition into the svbc phase.,width=226 ]    to estimate the boundary of the svbc phase we study several xc cylinders with @xmath2 varying from 0.28 to 0.40 using the method in fig . \n [ phase ] . \n these results show the svbc phase for @xmath31 . \n we also use the entanglement entropy and its first derivative with respect to @xmath2 to estimate the phase transition point . \n we make vertical cuts between zigzag columns , the dividing line between the two parts of the system bisecting a column of horizontal bonds , and measure the entanglement entropy . \n as seen in fig . \n [ entro ] , the entropy drops in going from the intermediate phase to the svbc . \n the derivative of the entropy shows a peak around 0.37 for the xc8 - 0 cylinder , and around 0.36 for the wider xc10 - 0 and xc12 - 0 cylinders . \n in addition , the height of this peak increases with the system width , as expected for a peak indicating a phase transition @xcite . \n on xc cylinders , we find that the svbc state has strong first- and second - neighbor correlations along diagonal directions , forming diagonally oriented ladders . thus , there are two degenerate diagonal svbc states on an xc cylinder , whereas for yc cylinders there is only the one vertical svbc pattern ( fig . \n 2 ) . for an infinite two - dimensional system , \n all three of these svbc ground states would be degenerate by rotational symmetry . in the classical limit , for large @xmath2 values \n , the ground state is a spin spiral state . however , quantum fluctuations are strong enough to melt the spiral order and form the svbc , in agreement with ref . \n @xcite .    in the rest of this letter , we focus specifically on @xmath17 inside the intermediate phase @xcite . to measure magnetic correlations , we apply `` pinning '' magnetic fields at one end of the cylinder and measure the resulting magnetization pattern . unlike in the af phase \n , the induced magnetization decays exponentially from the end of the cylinder with a decay length of 2 to 3 lattice spacings for various cylinders . \n we further check the response to a local magnetic field applied to a spin at the cylinder center . \n this local magnetic field response is quite short ranged . \n it only influences its nearby surrounding sites , as opposed to generating a large region of staggered magnetization in the af phase .     on ( a ) yc7 - 3 , ( b ) xc9 - 1 and ( c ) xc12 - 0 cylinders . \n the widths of the lines are proportional to @xmath32 for all the plots , with solid blue(dashed red ) lines for negative(positive ) values . \n the bond strength scale is indicated at the top . \n the three different sublattices of plaquettes are labeled as a , b , c. in these figures , we keep @xmath33 states in our dmrg calculation . the truncation error for xc9 - 1 is smaller than @xmath34 , while it is near @xmath35 for the wider yc7 - 3 and xc12 - 0 cylinders.,width=321 ]    references @xcite suggest that the intermediate phase is a pvb phase with long - range dimer - dimer correlations . \n to investigate pvb ordering we study cylinders with periodic boundary conditions that are compatible with pvb order , including yc4 - 0 , yc6 - 0 , yc7 - 3 , yc8 - 0 , xc6 - 0 , xc9 - 1 and xc12 - 0 @xcite . \n we pin the pvb pattern at the cylinder ends by the choice of which spins are kept and how long the cylinder is ( see fig . \n [ pvb ] ) . \n we define a local pvb order parameter at each site using the nearest - neighbor spin correlations on the three adjacent plaquettes . \n the plaquettes form three sublattices in the pvb phase , as labeled in figs . \n [ pvb](a ) and [ pvb](b ) , and one plaquette from each sublattice is adjacent to each site . \n let @xmath36 be the sum over the six bonds around plaquette a. then , we define the local pvb order parameter as @xmath37 near the ends of the cylinders , this order parameter is nonzero , and in general it is a complex number . \n we extrapolate this local order parameter versus the truncation error to estimate its values in the limit of large bond dimension @xmath38 . for long cylinders \n , its magnitude decays exponentially with distance from the end , with a correlation length @xmath39 that depends on the cylinder , as shown in the inset of fig . \n [ pdecay ] . \n these pvb correlations can be slightly incommensurate , particularly for the narrower yc cylinders . for the xc9 - 1 cylinder with a shifted connection \n , we measure the distance from the end along the direction perpendicular to the wrapping vector to obtain the shortest pvb correlation length @xmath39 .     for different cylinder circumferences @xmath40 at @xmath17 . \n the black circles indicate yc cylinders , while the red diamonds indicate xc cylinders . \n the straight green line illustrates the expected linear behavior at the quantum critical point of the two - dimensional system . \n the inset shows the local pvb order parameter versus distance from the end of the cylinder in lattice spacings . \n the estimated pvb correlation length @xmath39 is indicated for each cylinder.,width=264 ]    the pvb correlation length @xmath39 versus cylinder circumference @xmath40 is shown in fig . \n [ pdecay ] . \n this figure includes cylinders with all orientations , and we see that for our larger circumferences , the xc cylinders appear to have a longer pvb correlation length than the yc cylinders . if the 2d system is at a quantum critical point , the correlation length is expected to be proportional to the circumference by standard finite - size scaling . \n it appears that the correlation length actually increases faster than the circumference , suggesting that this system may have weak pvb long - range order in the 2d limit of infinite circumference .    in conclusion \n , we have studied the @xmath0 honeycomb @xmath41 heisenberg model on various cylinders extensively using dmrg . \n we find that the ground state displays a paramagnetic phase for @xmath16 . by studying pvb order on various cylinders , we find that the pvb correlation length grows at least linearly with the cylinder circumference . \n this suggests that in this phase the system is either quantum critical or has weak long - range pvb order . \n these results are compatible with an early theoretical study that a direct phase transition between an af and a pvb state is possible on the honeycomb lattice @xcite . \n we thank hong -

    "the formation of protostellar disks out of molecular cloud cores is still not fully understood . under ideal mhd conditions \n , the removal of angular momentum from the disk progenitor by the typically embedded magnetic field may prevent the formation of a rotationally supported disk during the main protostellar accretion phase of low mass stars . \n this has been known as the magnetic braking problem and the most investigated mechanism to alleviate this problem and help removing the excess of magnetic flux during the star formation process , the so called ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) , has been shown to be not sufficient to weaken the magnetic braking at least at this stage of the disk formation . in this work , motivated by recent progress in the understanding of magnetic reconnection in turbulent environments \n , we appeal to the diffusion of magnetic field mediated by magnetic reconnection as an alternative mechanism for removing magnetic flux . \n we investigate numerically this mechanism during the later phases of the protostellar disk formation and show its high efficiency . by means of fully 3d mhd simulations , \n we show that the diffusivity arising from turbulent magnetic reconnection is able to transport magnetic flux to the outskirts of the disk progenitor at time scales compatible with the collapse , allowing the formation of a rotationally supported disk around the protostar of dimensions @xmath0 100 au , with a nearly keplerian profile in the early accretion phase . \n since mhd turbulence is expected to be present in protostellar disks , this is a natural mechanism for removing magnetic flux excess and allowing the formation of these disks . \n this mechanism dismiss the necessity of postulating a hypothetical increase of the ohmic resistivity as discussed in the literature . \n together with our earlier work which showed that magnetic flux removal from molecular cloud cores is very efficient , this work calls for reconsidering the relative role of ad for the processes of star and planet formation .",

    "most nervous systems encode information about stimuli in the responding activity of large neuronal networks . \n this activity often manifests itself as dynamically coordinated sequences of action potentials . since multiple electrode recordings are now a standard tool in neuroscience research , it is important to have a measure of such network - wide behavioral coordination and information sharing , applicable to multiple neural spike train data . \n we propose a new statistic , _ informational coherence _ , which measures how much better one unit can be predicted by knowing the dynamical state of another . \n we argue informational coherence is a measure of association and shared information which is superior to traditional pairwise measures of synchronization and correlation . to find the dynamical states , we use a recently - introduced algorithm which reconstructs effective state spaces from stochastic time series . \n we then extend the pairwise measure to a multivariate analysis of the network by estimating the network multi - information . \n we illustrate our method by testing it on a detailed model of the transition from gamma to beta rhythms .    much of the most important information in neural systems is shared over multiple neurons or cortical areas , in such forms as population codes and distributed representations @xcite . on behavioral time scales , \n neural information is stored in temporal patterns of activity as opposed to static markers ; therefore , as information is shared between neurons or brain regions , it is physically instantiated as coordination between entire sequences of neural spikes . \n furthermore , neural systems and regions of the brain often require coordinated neural activity to perform important functions ; acting in concert requires multiple neurons or cortical areas to share information @xcite . \n thus , if we want to measure the dynamic network - wide behavior of neurons and test hypotheses about them , we need reliable , practical methods to detect and quantify behavioral coordination and the associated information sharing across multiple neural units . these would be especially useful in testing ideas about how particular forms of coordination relate to distributed coding ( e.g. , that of @xcite ) . \n current techniques to analyze relations among spike trains handle only pairs of neurons , so we further need a method which is extendible to analyze the coordination in the network , system , or region as a whole . here \n we propose a new measure of behavioral coordination and information sharing , _ informational coherence _ \n , based on the notion of dynamical state . \n section [ sec : synch - measures ] argues that coordinated behavior in neural systems is often not captured by existing measures of synchronization or correlation , and that something sensitive to nonlinear , stochastic , predictive relationships is needed . \n section [ sec : states - and - ic ] defines informational coherence as the ( normalized ) mutual information between the dynamical states of two systems and explains how looking at the states , rather than just observables , fulfills the needs laid out in section [ sec : synch - measures ] . since we rarely know the right states \n a prori _ , section [ sec : reconstruction ] briefly describes how we reconstruct effective state spaces from data . \n section [ sec : estimating - states - and - ic ] gives some details about how we calculate the informational coherence and approximate the global information stored in the network . \n section [ sec : example ] applies our method to a model system ( a biophysically detailed conductance - based model ) comparing our results to those of more familiar second - order statistics . in the interest of space \n , we omit proofs and a full discussion of the existing literature , giving only minimal references here ; proofs and references will appear in a longer paper now in preparation .",

the latter resonance was suggested to be excited by @xmath21 . \n the two resonances may have rather different wave functions @xcite . \n studies of the reaction @xmath22 suggested that the low - energy tail of the roper resonance might decay to both @xmath3 and @xmath23 @xcite . \n obviously , the @xmath0 partial wave is not sufficiently constrained by precision data and supports very different interpretations .    in this letter \n , we present data on @xmath24 of the a2-taps collaboration at the mainz microtron ( mami ) electron accelerator @xcite and of the cb - elsa collaboration at the bonn electron stretcher accelerator ( elsa ) @xcite . \n the bonn set up and the analysis method was described briefly in the preceding paper @xcite . here \n we give only a short summary of the taps setup , for more details see @xcite . \n earlier data taken at mami @xcite have smaller statistics and are not discussed here . \n the photon energy at mami covered the range 285820mev . \n the photon energies were measured in the glasgow tagged photon facility @xcite with an average energy resolution of 2mev . \n the taps detector @xcite consisted of six blocks each with 62 hexagonally shaped baf@xmath25 crystals arranged in an 8@xmath268 matrix and a forward wall with 138 baf@xmath25 crystals arranged in a 11@xmath2614 rectangle . \n this setup covered @xmath2740% of @xmath28 . \n the @xmath29 reaction channel was identified by constructing the 4-momenta of the two neutral pions from their @xmath30 decays ;

    "thermodynamics is one of the oldest and well - established branches of physics that sets boundaries to what can possibly be achieved in macroscopic systems . \n while it started as a purely classical theory , it was realized in the early days of quantum mechanics that large quantum devices , such as masers or lasers , can be treated with the thermodynamic formalism  @xcite . \n remarkable progress has been made recently in the miniaturization of heat engines  @xcite all the way to the single brownian particle  @xcite as well as to a single atom  @xcite . however , despite several theoretical proposals  @xcite , the implementation of heat machines in the fully quantum regime remains a challenge . here , \n we report an experimental realization of a quantum absorption refrigerator in a system of three trapped ions , with three of its normal modes of motion coupled by a trilinear hamiltonian such that heat transfer between two modes refrigerates the third . \n we investigate the dynamics and steady - state properties of the refrigerator and compare its cooling capability when only thermal states are involved to the case when squeezing is employed as a quantum resource . \n we also study the performance of such a refrigerator in the single shot regime  @xcite , and demonstrate cooling below both the steady - state energy and the benchmark predicted by the classical thermodynamics treatment . \n rapid progress in the experimental control of small quantum systems revives interest in the merging of thermodynamics with quantum mechanics  @xcite and poses fundamental questions : what is the smallest heat machine one can build  @xcite ? can quantum effects improve the performance of a heat engine , and if so , can we use quantum correlations as a fuel  @xcite ? \n while a lot of work in this field is focused on heat engines , we consider here another standard example of a heat machine : the absorption refrigerator . \n the first such device was invented in 1850 by the carr brothers  @xcite and was one of the first practical refrigerators used in industry . \n modern designs incorporating numerous technical improvements  @xcite remain a popular choice of refrigeration devices  @xcite . in general ( fig . \n [ fig : heat_flow ] ) , an absorption refrigerator consists of three parts : cold , hot and work bodies . \n it makes use of heat from the work body to cool down the cold one , while transferring heat to the hot body . \n although the classical thermodynamics of the absorption refrigerator is well understood  @xcite , its description in terms of quantum mechanics is still a subject of numerous theoretical studies  @xcite , and several proposals to implement it in the quantum regime using a system of superconducting qubits  @xcite or quantum dots  @xcite exist in the literature .     * \n experimental setup . \n a*. schematic of the linear rf - paul trap with three trapped @xmath0yb@xmath1 ions . \n the raman beams ( r1 , r2 , and r3 ) are responsible for applying the optical dipole force for the state preparation , and for coupling the ions motional modes to the internal state during the motional state detection . \n two ( grey ) ions are prepared in the @xmath2  dark \" state ( see methods ) . \n the radial confinement of the ions provided by radiofrequency ( rf ) potential , can be fine tuned by adjusting the offset voltage applied to the diagonally opposite trap electrodes . \n the speed of this tuning is controlled by a pair of low - pass filters ( lpfs ) . \n * b , * direction of heat flow in the absorption refrigerator . \n energy from the work body is transferred to the hot body , which pumps energy from cold body to hot body . \n the black arrows label the motional eigenmodes utilized as heat bodies ]    here we study the performance of absorption refrigeration in the quantum regime , utilizing the modes of motion of trapped ytterbium ions as the heat bodies ( fig . \n [ fig : heat_flow ] ) . \n we experimentally test two hypotheses : whether the absorption refrigerator performs better when the thermal state of the work mode is squeezed  @xcite , and whether there is an advantage when operating in the single - shot cooling regime  @xcite . \n the latter relies on coherent population oscillations that can occur among the coupled modes in the quantum system before the steady state is reached . \n the interaction hamiltonian in the system of three ions , induced by anharmonicity of the coulomb repulsion between the ions , has the form  @xcite @xmath3 where the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are the annihilation ( creation ) operators for the corresponding harmonic oscillators labeled by @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the coupling rate . here @xmath8 is the equilibrium distance between the ions , @xmath9 is the ion mass , @xmath10 is the ion charge , @xmath11 is the vacuum permittivity , and @xmath12 is the single ion axial trap frequency . the hamiltonian   is valid in the rotating wave approximation when the mode frequencies satisfy the resonance condition @xmath13 .    to understand how this absorption refrigerator works  @xcite , \n consider the following scenario : when the temperature of the work ( @xmath14 ) mode is higher than the hot ( @xmath15 ) mode , some energy tends to flow from the former to the latter . \n due to the structure of the interaction hamiltonian  , transfer of energy from ( @xmath14 ) to ( @xmath15 ) is always accompanied by energy transfer from ( @xmath16 ) to ( @xmath15 ) resulting in the cooling of the cold ( @xmath16 ) mode . at some temperatures \n this process is balanced by the flow of the energy in opposite direction , leading to an equilibrium . for thermal states \n , it then requires the mean phonon numbers @xmath17 to fulfill ( see methods ) @xmath18 if the system is initially prepared at @xmath19 away from equilibrium , the interaction hamiltonian   can only lead to mean phonon numbers @xmath20 such that @xmath21 . to demonstrate the equilibrium performance of the refrigerator , we start with all modes prepared in thermal states ( see methods ) . \n we fix @xmath22 in the hot mode and change @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for each value of @xmath23 and @xmath24 \n we measure the mean phonon numbers of the hot mode at long interaction times @xmath25 at which they have effectively converged to their long - time average values ( see fig .  [ \n fig : axial_mode_evol_and_equil ] ) . for each @xmath23 \n we find an equilibrium @xmath26 which gives @xmath27 and plot these points in panel ( e ) . for majority of the points shown on the fig . \n [ fig : axial_mode_evol_and_equil ] the temperatures @xmath28^{-1}$ ] corresponding to the mean phonon numbers @xmath29 , satisfy the condition @xmath30 that implies the refrigeration of the cold mode  @xcite . here \n @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant \n .     * absorption refrigeration demonstration . \n ( a - d ) , * the difference @xmath32 plotted against the initial cold mode phonon number , @xmath24 for different initial @xmath23 . \n the shaded curves are predictions of equation   ( blue ) and numerical simulations of   ( green ) , taking experimental uncertainty of initial state preparation into account . \n the numerical simulations of   agree well with the experiment . \n the equilibrium cold mode phonon number @xmath26 , which corresponds to @xmath33 ( dashed line ) , is determined by a linear extrapolation using two points that are closest to it . \n * e , * the obtained values are then plotted against initial @xmath23 and compared to the predictions of equation  [ eq : second_law_nbar_text ] . \n the absorption refrigeration occurs at the region at which the cold mode temperature is the lowest ( blue dots ) . \n the red dot does not reach the refrigeration effect since work mode temperature is lower . \n the green zone indicates no cooling according to inequality  . ] \n we further notice in fig . \n [ fig : axial_mode_evol_and_equil](a - d ) that experimental points systematically disagree with equation   away from equilibrium . indeed \n , the numerical simulations of   ( see methods ) predict that the system approaches a non - thermal and correlated steady state in the long - time limit . \n the steady state of each mode is then better characterized by the mean phonon number @xmath34 ( energy ) rather than temperature . \n for cooling the cold mode ( @xmath35 ) , the following inequality must be satisfied  @xcite ( see methods ) @xmath36 to investigate the cooling properties away from equilibrium , we focus on the mean phonon number of the cold mode whose temporal evolution is shown in fig .  [ \n fig : cooling_cold_mode](a - f ) . \n for @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,    we observe a nett decrease of the cold mode mean phonon number in panels ( a , b ) , equilibrium in ( c ) , and an increase in ( d - f ) . \n the data points are plotted relative to the computed long - time averages and show good agreement with theory . \n the nett difference of the final steady state from the initial mean phonon number is shown in fig . \n [ fig : cooling_cold_mode]g . again the long - time average values predicted by quantum theory match the experiment quite well , while prediction of equation   disagrees with the data . \n we next study the influence of quantum mechanical coherence . \n we prepare a squeezed thermal state of the work mode  @xcite and compare cooling performance to the case where the mode is prepared in a thermal state of the same mean phonon number . squeezing increases the mean phonon number from @xmath23 to @xmath39cosh@xmath40  sinh@xmath41 , with @xmath42 the squeezing parameter  @xcite . \n the experiment is repeated for several values of @xmath42 , keeping @xmath23 fixed . \n when @xmath42 increases ( fig . \n [ fig : cooling_cold_mode](h - k )    ) , the system undergoes a transition from heating to cooling , as can be seen from the evolution of the cold mode . \n we plot the difference of final and initial mean phonon numbers in panel ( l ) for direct comparison to the previously discussed thermal case in ( g ) . \n the nett change in the mean phonon number is now smaller , which implies that squeezing of the work mode decreases the cooling performance . \n further simulations show that , for a fixed @xmath23 , cooling is indeed most effective when no squeezing is applied at all . \n * absorption refrigerator operating in the single shot regime . \n * the difference @xmath43 between the measured initial phonon number and the mean phonon number at interaction time @xmath44 that gives the strongest cooling ( colored points ) , is shown for several @xmath23 . \n the blue shaded region corresponds to the range of predicted by   after taking the experimental uncertainty of @xmath45 into account and the green shaded region is the long time average predicted by numerical simulations . \n the uncertainty in the x - axis is the error of the fit to the measured initial work population , while the uncertainty in the y - axis represents one standard deviation of the statistical uncertainty . ] \n we now focus on the single - shot cooling method  @xcite . here \n the interaction is switched off at the right moment such that the evolution halts at a transient state with a lower mean phonon number @xmath46 than the steady state one @xmath47 . \n conversely , one would achieve a higher mean phonon number than the steady - state value in the heating regime . \n both regimes can be seen in fig . \n [ fig : cooling_cold_mode](a - f ) , where the greatest deviation of @xmath46 from the initial @xmath24 is consistently reached at about @xmath48s of interaction time , @xmath49 . \n we plot in fig . \n [ fig : eq_violation ] the difference between the initial and this value for different work mode phonon numbers @xmath23 . \n the first data point at @xmath50 has a vanishing difference since it corresponds to the system at thermal equilibrium according to \n . however , the difference increases with growing @xmath23 , and exceeds the long - time steady - state value consistently and significantly  a striking demonstration of the advantage of coherence - assisted single - shot cooling  @xcite . \n note that the cooling even exceeds the thermal equilibrium values set by  , which could be viewed as a classical thermodynamics benchmark . \n the ability to cool more efficiently and on a shorter timescale is related to the transient coherence generated during the unitary time evolution under the trilinear hamiltonian  . \n indeed , it is easily shown that an incoherent version of the trilinear interaction ( see methods ) precludes the device from cooling further than the steady - state occupation  @xcite . in conclusion , we have demonstrated an implementation of an absorption refrigerator utilizing the harmonic modes of motion in a trapped - ion system . \n we have shown that the classical concept of the absorption refrigerator can be extended to the quantum domain , and its cooling power per unit mass ( @xmath51 2.4 w / kg ) is comparable to its classical counterparts.19 w / kg . ] \n the experiment confirms our theoretical understanding of the refrigerator dynamics and its steady - state characteristics based on a coherent three - body interaction model . in particular , we could observe that , starting away from equilibrium , the system energies rapidly approach a steady state , even in the absence of environmental coupling . \n simple arguments based on equilibrium thermodynamics do not predict this steady state , although they give the correct temperature requirements for cooling . while it was shown that utilizing squeezed states allows the refrigerator to transition from a heating to cooling regime , hence demonstrating that squeezing could be used as a quantum fuel , when directly compared to the thermal work reservoir we could also observe a diminished performance of the refrigerator . \n this leads to the surprising implication that exploiting quantum resources does not necessarily enhance , but may even be detrimental to the performance of heat machines \n an issue worth studying further . on the other hand , \n we demonstrate a significant advantage with respect to both steady - state cooling and thermodynamic benchmark when we operate the refrigerator in a single - shot regime .",

    "we summarize the theoretical consensus of the hix workshop concerning those measurements which seem most appropriate for inclusion in the `` white paper '' being prepared to justify the proposed 12 gev upgrade at jefferson lab . \n the criteria for inclusion are that such measurements should be decisive , not possible elsewhere and should answer crucial physics questions with broad implications . \n = 135 mm = 215 mm # 1phys . \n rev . \n * # 1 * # 1phys .  lett .  * # 1 * # 1phys . \n rev . \n lett .  * # 1 * 2    invited talk presented at hix2000 + temple university . \n march 30  april 1 , 2000 + adp-00 - 39/t422    introduction    although a great many innovative and exciting suggestions were made for physics investigations following the proposed 12 gev upgrade , it was eventually necessary to focus on two main themes . \n we deal with these in turn below . \n the first is the possibility of unambiguously determining the valence @xmath0 and @xmath1 quark distributions of the free nucleon in the region of bjorken @xmath2 above 0.4 ( and as close as possible to 1 ) . in particular , while the valence @xmath0 distribution is relatively well known , it has recently been realized that the @xmath1 distribution is very poorly determined in this region  at least if one requires that the determination should be demonstrably model independent . for the polarized valence distributions , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , \n the situation is even worse , with no measurements at all for @xmath2 above 0.5 . \n experiments with @xmath5he and @xmath5h targets , following the 12 gev upgrade , could resolve the longstanding problem concerning the valence @xmath1 distribution for @xmath2 up to 0.85  establishing finally whether or not the predictions of perturbative qcd are correct . \n as a by - product one would complete our knowledge of the emc effect over the full range of nuclear mass number . \n using polarized proton and @xmath5he targets one could also complete the determination of the polarized distributions @xmath3 and @xmath4 over the same region of @xmath2 . \n the result of this program would be a definitive picture of the valence structure of the nucleon , including its spin dependence . \n measurements using polarized proton and @xmath5he targets at the 12 gev facility would also allow one to definitively establish the twist-3 component of the structure functions @xmath6 and @xmath7  at least for low moments . \n this major advance would be made possible by a factor of 10 improvement in statistics over what has hitherto been possible and over a much greater range of bjorken @xmath2 : @xmath8 . from the theoretical point of view the twist-3 structure function \n provides totally novel information on the internal structure of the nucleon \n information that should be accessible to lattice qcd within the same ten year time frame .    at a \n later and more mature stage of development of the facility other exciting possibilities arise . \n one could use the knowledge of @xmath9 and @xmath4 , at relatively large @xmath2 , to test the validity of duality in this region and if it works to use it to obtain insight into these distributions for @xmath2 as large as 0.95 . \n we could also use this knowledge to test the utility of semi - inclusive measurements for determining spin and flavor dependence of parton distributions . \n if these tests are successful one could apply these methods to an accurate determination of the spin and flavor dependence of the nucleon sea in the region @xmath10 . \n finally , one could use a tensor polarized deuteron target to probe completely new structure functions such as @xmath11 for @xmath2 near and beyond 1 . \n large-@xmath2 valence distributions[sec : valence ]    the distribution of the valence quarks in the nucleon is one of its most fundamental properties . because of the relative 4:1 weighting for electromagnetic probes , the proton structure function primarily constrains the @xmath0 distribution in the proton . to determine the @xmath1 distribution requires a second measurement , traditionally using the deuteron . while the approximate treatment of the deuteron as a neutron and a proton at rest , so that @xmath12 , is not too bad for @xmath2 below ( say ) 0.4 , it breaks down badly at large @xmath2 \n nevertheless it is only in the past few years that it has been realized that a realistic treatment of the effects of fermi motion and binding in the deuteron lead to an extracted neutron structure function which is quite different from that used in all standard parametrizations of parton distributions . \n in particular , a reanalysis of slac data by melnitchouk and thomas @xcite suggested that the @xmath13 ratio may actually approach the pqcd prediction of @xmath14 @xcite , rather than 0 as @xmath15 .    while this analysis is persuasive @xcite , our knowledge of such fundamental properties should not be model dependent . \n fig . \n 1 shows the present , appalling state of our knowledge of @xmath13 at large @xmath2 . \n it is clearly vital to find a facility and a technique that allow us to map out the valence distributions in a model independent manner over the complete @xmath2 range and this problem was addressed by a number of participants at the workshop including bosted , forest , klein , leader , melnitchouk , meziani , olness , petratos and scopetta . \n it is in this context that the idea of using @xmath5he and @xmath5h targets is extremely exciting . \n the fundamental point is that charge symmetry is a very good symmetry for strongly interacting systems and these two mirror nuclei are related by charge symmetry . in the limit of exact charge symmetry \n the distribution of protons ( the neutron ) in @xmath5he would be the same as that of neutrons ( the proton ) in @xmath5h  regardless of the size of the emc effect in these nuclei ! \n a measurement of the structure functions of these two nuclei would then allow us to determine @xmath16 exactly . \n in practice there are electromagnetic corrections to be made and charge symmetry is slightly broken by the strong interaction . \n nevertheless , exact faddeev calculations of the structure of the a=3 nuclei allow us to estimate these corrections quite accurately  and to test the dependence of the nuclear structure functions on the two - nucleon potential used . in order to understand the analysis to be applied to the data we need to define the ratios : ( r^3he ) = f_2^^3he 2 f_2^p + f_2^n ; r(^3h ) = f_2^^3h f_2^p + 2 f_2^n , [ eq:1 ] and the super - ratio : = r(^3he ) r(^3h ) . \n [ eq:2 ] inverting these expressions directly yields the ratio of the free neutron to proton structure functions : @xmath17 we stress that @xmath18 extracted via eq.([eq:3 ] ) does not depend on the size of the emc effect in @xmath5he or @xmath5h , but rather on the _ ratio _ of the emc effects in @xmath5he and @xmath5h . \n if the neutron and proton distributions in the @xmath19 nuclei are not dramatically different , one might expect the super - ratio , @xmath20 to be approximately one . to test whether this is \n indeed the case requires an explicit calculation of the emc effect in the @xmath19 system . \n the super - ratio @xmath20 , calculated by afnan et al . \n @xcite , is shown in fig .  2 for the various nuclear model wave functions ( pest , rsc and yamaguchi ) , using the cteq parameterization @xcite of parton distributions at @xmath21  gev@xmath22 . \n the emc effects are seen to largely cancel over a large range of @xmath2 , out to @xmath23 , with the deviation from the central value , @xmath24 , lying within @xmath25 . \n furthermore , the dependence on the nuclear wave function is very weak . \n in addition to the dependence on the two - body force used one also needs to test the sensitivity of @xmath20 to the assumed nucleon structure functions . \n the detailed study may be found in ref.@xcite . for our purposes \n it is enough to say that while there is some sensitivity one can adopt a straightforward iterative procedure which is quite rapidly convergent , so that starting from standard distributions , like cteq , one can quickly converge to a self - consistent set of structure functions and @xmath20 . \n the corollary to this is that having determined @xmath26 and @xmath20 , one will not only pin down @xmath27 but will also determine the emc effect in @xmath5he and @xmath5h , as well as the deuteron , thus completing our experimental knowledge of the nuclear emc effect @xcite . \n this will be a vital assistance in sorting out the origin of this famous effect @xcite , especially the possible change of nucleon structure in a nuclear medium , which is fundamental to our understanding of qcd itself . \n spin dependent valence distributions    as noted earlier , the case for the determination of the spin dependent structure functions in the region @xmath28 is even clearer  there is no data in this region at all ! \n one does not even know , for example , whether the neutron spin structure function , @xmath29 , becomes positive in this region ! \n this was highlighted , for example , in the presentation of leader who made important connections to `` old fashioned '' analysing power data ( @xmath30 ) @xcite . \n it is remarkable that the focus on the `` spin crisis '' has diverted so much effort to small @xmath2 that nothing is known in the large @xmath2 region . while there is room for more work , especially on exchange current corrections ( mesons , @xmath31 s , etc . ) \n , it seems that one can determine @xmath29 relatively well from measurements with a polarized @xmath5he target @xcite , while accurate data on the proton may be simplified by the development of a better @xmath32 target . \n it is clear that jefferson lab , with the 12 gev upgrade , can provide a definitive picture of the spin dependent valence structure functions in the large @xmath2 region , thus completing one of the fundamental tasks of the international program in deep inelastic scattering . on the theoretical side , \n apart from the comparison with qcd inspired models @xcite , one can expect these distributions to be accessible to lattice qcd over the same time frame @xcite . \n twist-3 structure functions    a compelling case was presented by ji , bosted , averett , meziani and others that following the proposed upgrade , jefferson lab could determine @xmath33 for both the proton and neutron , with an order of magnitude improvement in statistical accuracy in the range @xmath34 . \n this would enable one to remove the trivial twist-2 contribution and unambiguously isolate the twist-3 piece . \n as this involves _ totally novel _ \n information on the internal structure of the target , it should provide extremely important new information on the internal structure of hadrons @xcite . \n for example , the second moment of the twist-3 part of @xmath33 , @xmath35 , involves the matrix elements @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the color magnetic field inside the hadron . this will be the first indication of the correlation of the quark and gluon fields inside a hadron . \n conclusion    the consensus of the participants at this workshop were that , following an upgrade to 12 gev , jefferson lab would be able to provide important and definitive answers to our questions concerning the spin and flavor distributions of the valence quarks in the nucleon . \n it would also be able to provide the first unambiguous information on the twist-3 structure functions of the nucleon , that is the correlations between quarks and gluons in the proton . \n this represents an outstanding physics program .    as a side benefit of the determination of the valence @xmath1 distribution we would also have accurate measurements of the emc effect in @xmath5he , @xmath5h and the deuteron for the first time , thus allowing a complete study of the nuclear emc effect and the possible change of nucleon structure in medium .    following these top priority investigations \n there are numerous other important studies to be made . \n it is vital to explore the validity of bloom gilman scaling @xcite for spin structure functions @xcite . \n as we have already seen from jefferson lab data , scaling may well work where one has no theoretical reason to justify it ( yet ) . \n if it can be shown to work one could use the technique to study a host of quantities at large @xmath2 , notably @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , etc . as explained in detail by mulders , leader and ent @xcite , \n semi - inclusive measurements allow us probe a large number of new observables . \n as emphasised by mitchell , one can also use a tensor polarized target to determine the new spin structure function @xmath11 , which is expected to be significant at large @xmath2 . \n one could investigate the spin dependence of the emc effect at large @xmath2 @xcite using @xmath42 and @xmath43 targets . \n as emphasised by brodsky and liuti , one can investigate quark and gluon correlations in the nucleon by measuring higher twist structure functions . \n as discussed by kumar , parity violation can also be exploited to study parton distributions .    in summary , there is an urgent physics case for the 12 gev upgrade in order to answer vital and topical questions which go to the heart of our understanding of strongly interacting systems .",
    "using deep high - resolution multi - band images taken with the _ very large telescope _ and the hubble space telescope , we discovered a new anomalous sequence in the color magnitude diagram of @xmath0  cen . \n this feature appears as a narrow , well - defined sub giant branch ( sgb - a ) , which merges into the main sequence of the dominant cluster population at a magnitude significantly fainter than the cluster turn - off ( to ) . \n the simplest hypothesis assumes that the new feature is the extension of the anomalous red giant branch ( rgb - a ) metal - rich population discovered by lee et al . \n ( 1999 ) and pancino et al . \n ( 2000 ) . however , under this assumption the interpretation of the sgb - a does not easily fit into the context of a self - enrichment scenario within @xmath0  cen . \n in fact , its to magnitude , shape and extension are not compatible with a young , metal - rich population , as required by the self - enrichment process . \n the to level of the sgb - a suggests indeed an age as old as the main cluster population , further supporting the extra - cluster origin of the most metal rich stars , as suggested by ferraro , bellazzini & pancino ( 2002 ) \n . only accurate measurements of radial velocities and metal abundances for a representative sample of stars will firmly establish whether or not the sgb - a is actually related to the rgb - a and will finally shed light on the origin of the metal rich population of @xmath0  cen .",

state qubits with the advantage of exceptionally long spin coherence times and the potential to be integrated into the existing semiconductor device technology @xcite . \n recent experiments have shown that donor nuclear spins in enriched silicon can achieve coherence times exceeding 30 minutes even at room temperature due to a semiconductor vacuum - like environment for spins @xcite . \n however , the relative isolation of the nuclear spins from their environment also makes it difficult to prepare , and readout their spin states . \n several recent experiments have utilized optical techniques to initialize and readout the donor nuclear spins in silicon by photoexcitation of a donor bound exciton - a three - particle system with two electrons and a hole bound to the donor @xcite . \n while these experiments have so far been performed on bulk donor ensembles , the techniques will offer the best rewards if extended to single donor spin qubits in the already existing design schemes of a silicon quantum computer @xcite . unlike the dominant spin readout techniques that rely on spin - to - charge conversion , optical readout can offer higher fidelities as it is not limited by temperature dependent broadening in the leads . \n = 3.4 in    [ fi1 ]    in this letter , we investigate the electronic structure of the donor bound exciton ( d@xmath0x ) in silicon under the influence of electric fields and interfaces , thus mimicking the environment of realistic devices . \n this is required since single spin readout in a quantum computer can not be achieved in a bulk environment but requires a device environment . \n the electronic states of the donor bound exciton are influenced by the complicated bandstructure of silicon including its multiple valley degeneracy in the conduction band ( cb ) , the light and heavy hole valence bands ( vb ) , the coulomb bound donor states and the three - particle fermionic interactions . \n we include all these factors in quantitative details using an atomistic tight - binding method over a silicon lattice of one million atoms , and compute the spin - resolved transition energies and transition dipoles of the d@xmath0x in a gated nanostructure . for specificity \n , we refer here only to the most common shallow donor in silicon , phosphorus . \n these methods can readily be generalized to the other shallow donors sb , as and bi , which have slightly different electronic binding energies , and also different nuclear spins and hyperfine constants . \n three - partcile excitons or trions have also been reported recently in two - dimensional materials such as mos@xmath1 @xcite and have attracted much attention as a test - bed for studying many - body interactions in a semiconductor with both spin and valley degrees of freedom . \n previous theoretical studies in bulk d@xmath0x in silicon have been performed from effective mass approximations to understand auger recombination in donors @xcite and more recently to investigate applications such as quantum hall charge sensors @xcite . \n this work presents atomistic electronic structure calculations of the d@xmath0x in a device environment for the first time , crucial for experiments to integrate optical addressing methods in a silicon quantum computer . \n a neutral p donor in bulk silicon comprises a positively charged donor core that produces a coulomb potential and binds an electron 45 mev below the conduction band edge ( also called the d@xmath0 state ) . \n if stimulated by a laser pulse of appropriate wavelength , an additional electron and a hole can be generated and bound to the impurity , forming the donor bound exciton ( d@xmath0x ) , as shown in fig . \n 1a ) for a bulk donor , with blue and red representing the electron and hole wavefunction probability densities respectively . \n the bulk transition energy from a d@xmath0 to a d@xmath0x state has been measured to be near 1150 mev @xcite . \n fig . \n 1b ) shows a schematic of the same system under an applied electric field . \n both the d@xmath0 and the d@xmath0x undergo a stark shift , however the latter is more strongly perturbed due to the larger size of the wavefunction . \n the electric field pushes the electrons and holes in opposite directions and thus changes the excitation wavelength from @xmath2 to @xmath3 . \n fig . \n 1c ) shows the combined effect of an interface and an electric field with excitation wavelength @xmath4 . in this case , the donor wave functions are also truncated by the interface . \n later , we will show the transition energies , hartree energy , wavefunctions and transition dipole moments for these three cases , as well as the interface and e - field induced hyperfine and hole splitting that can affect the spin - resolved transition energies . \n = 3.4 in    [ fi2 ]    in fig . \n 2 , a schematic of the energy levels of the d@xmath0 and d@xmath0x are shown for a bulk - like exciton and an exciton in a nanoscale device . in the d@xmath0 state , \n the hyperfine interaction between the nuclear and the electronic spins produces a singlet and a triplet splitting @xmath5 . \n the d@xmath0x has two electrons spin paired in a singlet with @xmath6 , and as a result , the spin splitting in a b - field is governed by the hole 3/2 and 1/2 total angular momentum states , which arise from the heavy hole ( hh ) and the light hole ( lh ) bands . \n if the donor is located close to an interface or subjected to an electrical field , then the transition energies of the d@xmath0x are strongly modified , as shown in fig . \n 2b ) . \n first , the presence of an interface or electric field changes the localization of all the confined particles in both d@xmath0 and d@xmath0x . as the wave functions shift and deform in space , the particle - particle interactions also change . \n we have computed this transition energy from self - consistent hartree method with tight - binding , and denote it as @xmath7 . \n second , the electric field or the interface also splits the 3/2 and 1/2 states of the hole bound to the d@xmath0x , which we denote as @xmath8 . \n this splitting is due to the effect of confinement on the hh and lh bands , which have different effective masses . \n third , the hyperfine coupling of the d@xmath0 state also changes due to the field and depth @xcite , and is denoted as @xmath9 in fig . \n 2b ) . \n details of how the spin - resolved d@xmath0x transitions can be used to initialize and readout the donor nuclear spins using an auger recombination process can be found in refs @xcite . \n = 3.4 in    [ fi3 ]    we employ an sp@xmath10d@xmath11s * atomic orbital tight - binding method with spin - orbit interaction and nearest neighbor coupling to represent the full band structure of silicon @xcite . \n more details of the methods can be found in the supplementary materials . \n first , we investigate the stark effect of the d@xmath0x when the donor is in bulk silicon . \n fig . \n 3 shows the coulomb energy , transition energy and transition dipole moment of the three - particle d@xmath0x for a bulk - like case as a function of an electric field . in the simulation , a bulk system is represented by a 30 nm @xmath12 30 nm @xmath12 30 nm of silicon lattice bounded by hydrogen passivated hard - walls on all sides . \n the donor is placed at the center of the box , and the simulation domain size is chosen such that the electronic and hole wavefunctions at zero e - field are not affected by the boundaries of the box . \n this is reasonable as the bohr radii of the d@xmath0 and d@xmath13 states are in the range of 1 - 4 nm . \n the coulomb energy of the d@xmath0x comprises of the repulsive energy between the two electrons and the attractive energy between the hole and each of the electrons . \n fig . \n 3a ) shows this three - particle coulomb energy with an e - field , computed from eq 3 of the supplementary materials ( sm ) . at low fields , \n the coulomb energy lies between 35 and 40 mevs , and decreases slightly with the field . \n it is known that the coulomb energy in the two - electron d@xmath13 state is about 43 mev at zero e - field @xcite . \n therefore , the attractive energy of the hole in d@xmath0x reduces the total coulomb energy to sub 40 mev . as the e - field \n is increased , the electron and hole wavefunctions are spatially separated steadily , and the coulomb energy decreases . an abrupt drop in the coulomb energy \n is observed in fig . \n 3a ) at about f=1 mv / m as the hole and one of the electrons ionize to opposite surfaces of the bounding box . \n the e - field produces triangular wells at the opposite surfaces ( in the cb and vb ) . \n when the energy of the bound states in these triangular wells are lower than those of the coulomb bound states ( including mutual screening between the particles ) , the electrons and holes localize at the surfaces . as a result , the large spatial separation between the three particles at ionization reduces their net electrostatic interaction . \n the transition energy required to excite a d@xmath0 into a d@xmath0x state is computed from the difference of the total energies of the d@xmath0x and d@xmath0 as given by eq 6 of the sm , and is shown in fig 3b ) on the left vertical axis . \n using the low temperature bandgap of 1.17 ev in silicon , the transition energy at zero field ( f=0 ) is 1145 mev in close agreement with the experimental measurements @xcite . \n it is to be noted that no fitting parameters are used in the d@xmath0x simulations . as the e - field \n is increased , the transition energy drops gradually untill an abrupt drop is witnessed at f=1 mv / m due to field ionization . \n overall the transition energy decreases with e - field due to both the reduced coulomb energy and the reduced energy difference between the single particle orbital energies in the cb and in the vb . a reduced transition energy with e - field , \n however , does not mean that the d@xmath0 to d@xmath0x transition becomes more likely . \n the transition probability is governed by the dipole moment between the wavefunctions which depends strongly on their spatial overlaps . \n using eq 7 of the sm , we evaluated the transition dipole moment of the d@xmath0x in fig . \n 3b ) on the right vertical axis . \n it is shown that the dipole moment is large at low e - fields and close to the f=0 value , but decreases rapidly by orders of magnitude near f=1 mv / m . as the hole and one of the electrons are ionized towards opposite surfaces , the spatial overalp of the wavefunctions of the three particles diminish abruptly , making the d@xmath0 to d@xmath0x excitation unlikely . \n = 3.4 in    [ fi4 ]    fig . \n 4 shows the spatial probability densities of the electron and hole wavefunctions with an e - field applied along the vertical direction.the first row depicts the probability distributions ( a - c ) without an e - field , showing the electrons to be tightly bound to the donor as in the d@xmath13 state @xcite . \n since the hole experiences a weak negative potential of the two electrons , its probability distribution spreads out over a larger region , but is still far from the edges of the bounding box . \n hence , the use of 30 nm @xmath12 30 nm @xmath12 30 nm box to represent the bulk - case is justified . \n the hole wavefunction assumes a more p - like structure as shown by the lower density at the core ( green ) and a larger density rim ( red ) surrounding it . as a vertical e - field of 1 \n mv / m is applied in the second row , one of the electrons remains donor bound ( d ) , while the other electron is pulled opposite the e - field towards the top surface ( e ) . \n the hole , on the other hand , is pushed towards the back surface in a direction along the e - field ( f ) . \n hence , the overlap between the three particles decreases . \n however , both the electrons and the holes still have some density at the core , showing that the ionization at this field is only partial . \n the 3rd row shows the complete ionization case at a large e - field of 2 mv / m , in which the electron ( h ) and hole wavefunctions ( i ) are fully localized near the surface . at even larger biases , \n the donor bound electron ( g ) will eventually also ionize to the surface , but this regime is not pertinent to this work .    = 3.4 in    [ fi5 ]    next , we investigate the stark effect of the d@xmath0x when the donor is closer to a surface , which is more representative of a realistic device . \n it was shown in prior works @xcite that a single electron bound to a donor in silicon can undergo strong orbital stark shift if the donor depth d from the surface is small ( typically @xmath14 6 nm ) . in this case , a large e - field can be applied without completely ionizing the donor electron . at these relatively large e - fields , \n the donor orbitals hybridize with the confined states of the triangular well at the surface , resulting in a gradual ( non - abrupt ) ionization process . \n fig . \n 5a ) shows the three - particle coulomb energy for the d@xmath0x when the donor is at 4.2 nm depth from the surface . \n the coulomb energy is still in the sub 40 mev range , but decreases slightly below the bulk value at f=0 . \n the high potential barrier at the surface not only truncates part of the wavefunction but also pushes the asymmetric charge densities a bit off the donor center with the electron wavefunctions slightly shifting deeper into the lattice and the hole wavefunction moving closer to the surface . \n the coulomb energy is maximum when the electron - hole charge densities are centered around the donor core , but decreases when the electron - hole wavefunctions are displaced from the donor core . \n a small applied e - field acts against the surface potential and pulls the electron - hole densities towards the donor core . \n hence , the coulomb energy is seen to increase at low e - fields and reaches a maximum of 39 mev . \n a larger applied field now pushes the electrons towards the surface and holes away from the surface ( acting opposite the e - field due to the surface potential ) , and decreases the coulomb energy monotonically . \n unlike the bulk case , the ionization process is gradual ( non - abrupt ) , and the coulomb energy curve appears smooth even when the hole and one of the electrons ioinize at about 10 mv / m . \n fig . \n 5b ) also shows the transition energy and dipole moments as before , however , these curves are also relatively smoother as the larger e - fields cause a gradual ionization of the electrons and holes . \n the ionizing field for the d@xmath0x is depth dependent . \n ignoring the donor potential and the inter - particle interactions , the potential drop between the donor location and the surface for electrons and holes is @xmath15 , where , @xmath16 is equal to the donor depth , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 equals the distance to the opposite surface , @xmath19 , in which @xmath20 is the thickness of the channel . \n hence , even for a donor close to an interface ( small @xmath17 ) the d@xmath0x disassociates already at moderate field strengths by removal of the hole if @xmath20 is large compared to @xmath17 . \n this is qualitatively different from field ionization of the d@xmath0 and d@xmath13 states @xcite . \n = 3.4 in    [ fi6 ]    in fig . 6 , we investigate the other two energy gaps , @xmath8 and @xmath5 , that influence the d@xmath0 to d@xmath0x transition energy , as shown in fig . \n 2b ) . \n the proximity to an interface and/or the presence of an applied field changes both the lh and hh splitting @xmath8 , and the hyperfine resonance energy @xmath5 . \n fig . \n 6a ) shows that @xmath8 increases with e - field both for bulk and interfacial donors , as the @xmath21 and @xmath22 states are affected differently , which is consistent with recent studies of boron acceptors in silicon @xcite . \n fig . \n 6b ) shows the variation of the hyperfine coupling with e - field for donors at various depths . the shift in the hyperfine coupling from a bulk donor \n can be directly evaluated using the amplitude of the d@xmath0 wavefunction at the donor site , as done in ref @xcite . \n @xmath23 for bulk - like donors ( d=15.2 nm ) varies from the bulk value of 117 mhz at small fields before abruptly diminishing to 0 as the donor ionizes . \n in contrast , @xmath23 for donors nearer to an interface can assume a continuous range of values ( 117 to 0 mhz ) depending on the field as the ionization process is gradual . \n also , much higher fields in the range of 10 - 40 mv / m can be applied to donors less than 5 nm deep without completely ionizing the d@xmath0 electron . \n there are two factors which we have ignored here , as they lie beyond the scope of this work . \n first , we have neglected exchange and correlation effects , and treated the problem within the hartree approximation for computational feasibility . \n there is a 5 mev difference between the calculated and measured bulk transition energy @xcite , as shown earlier , which could be due to this approximation . \n more justification of this approximation is provided in the sm . \n second , some residual strain has been reported recently in nano devices close to the oxide - silicon interface @xcite . \n although we have not included the effect of local strain in the calculations as it may vary from device to device , qualititatively the effect of strain is similar to that of the electric field . \n the strain may cause valley - repopulation of the donor , and reduce the weight of the electronic wavefunction in the central - cell . as a result \n , strain will reduce both the coulomb energy @xmath24 and the hyperfine coupling @xmath5 . \n in addition , strain removes the light and heavy hole degeneracy , and enhances @xmath8 , which has been shown in ref @xcite . \n we have shown that electric fields and interfaces can affect the transition energies and dipole moments of donor bound excitons in nanodevices quite siginificantly , and optical addressing techniques for donor qubits need to be aware of these changes to be successful . \n we have also performed the first atomistic electronic structure calculation of the donor bound exciton in silicon taking into account the full bandstructure and full donor energy spectrum using spin - resolved atomic orbitals of over a million atoms , and have obtained the three - particle coulomb energy , hyperfine and hole splittings , all of which contribute to the d@xmath0x transition energy . \n a detailed understanding of the range of excitation frequencies possible in nanoscale devices and the environmental conditions needed for a stable d@xmath0x helps to extend the optical addressing methods from bulk ensembles to single donor qubits , and may also enable hybrid opto - electric addressing of nuclear spins in silicon with improved fidelity and possible higher temperature operation . \n this research was conducted by the australian research council centre of excellence for quantum computation and communication technology ( project number ce110001027 ) . financial support from the the u.s . \n national security agency ( nsa ) and the army research office ( aro ) under contract no . \n w911nf-04 -

    "we examine the phase diagram of a simple - cubic optical lattice half - filled by two species of fermionic atoms with a repulsive @xmath0-wave contact interaction . \n we use the hartree approximation in the regime of weaker interactions , and a hubbard model approximation in the mott insulating phase . \n the regime where the nel phase of this system is likely to be most accessible to experiments is at intermediate lattice strengths and interactions , and our two approximations agree fairly well in this regime . \n we discuss the various issues that may determine where in this phase diagram the nel phase is first produced and detected experimentally , and analyze the quantum phases that occur in the intermediate lattice strength regime . \n one of the next notable milestones in the production of new strongly - correlated states of ultracold atoms is expected to be the antiferromagnetic nel phase of two hyperfine species of fermionic atoms in an optical lattice @xcite . \n important progress towards this goal includes the recent realization of the mott insulating phase with fermions @xcite , and the demonstration of controllable superexchange interactions in an optical lattice , albeit with bosonic atoms @xcite . \n the interest in experimentally realizing this nel phase is partly because it is a natural next step in developing an ultracold - atom quantum `` simulator '' of the fermionic hubbard model with repulsive interactions , which is one of the prototypical models in strongly - correlated quantum condensed - matter physics . \n as we will argue , if the objective is to access a phase with antiferromagnetic order , then it may be favorable to explore the regime of an optical lattice of intermediate depth , where the effective hamiltonian is more than just the standard one - band hubbard model . \n the low temperature phase diagram in this regime is worth exploring in its own right , as a new , interesting , and hopefully experimentally accessible quantum many - body system . \n an outline of our paper is as follows : first we review the physics of two - species fermions in an optical lattice , with the interactions tuned by a nearby feshbach resonance . \n we then describe the hartree approximation which captures the ground - state phase diagram , and use this calculation to estimate the line in the phase diagram along which antiferromagnetic interactions are strongest . for another approach to parts of the same phase diagram , we map the system onto a lattice hubbard model , which is appropriate for a strong lattice potential , and study which terms dominate the hamiltonian as one weakens the lattice away from the strong lattice regime \n . we also estimate the nel temperature in this strong - lattice approach , and show that it is maximized along a line in the phase diagram that agrees well with the line of maximal exchange interactions estimated using the hartree approximation . \n finally , we discuss experimental issues such as equilibration , feshbach molecule formation , and the size of the mott phase in a trap .",

    "motivated by the discovery of young , massive stars in the nuclei of some liner/ `` transition '' nuclei such as ngc 4569 , we have computed photoionization models to determine whether some of these objects may be powered solely by young star clusters rather than by accretion - powered active nuclei . \n the models were calculated with the photoionization code cloudy , using evolving starburst continua generated by the the starburst99  code of @xcite . \n we find that the models are able to reproduce the emission - line spectra of transition nuclei , but only for instantaneous bursts of solar or higher metallicity , and only for ages of @xmath0 myr , the period when the extreme - ultraviolet continuum is dominated by emission from wolf - rayet stars . for clusters \n younger than 3 myr or older than 6 myr , and for models with a constant star - formation rate , the softer ionizing continuum results in an emission spectrum more typical of regions . \n this model predicts that wolf - rayet emission features should appear in the spectra of transition nuclei . \n while such features have not generally been detected to date , they could be revealed in observations having higher spatial resolution . \n demographic arguments suggest that this starburst model may not apply to the majority of transition nuclei , particularly those in early - type host galaxies , but it could account for some members of the transition class in hosts of type sa and later . \n the starburst models during the wolf - rayet - dominated phase can also reproduce the narrow - line spectra of some liners , but only under conditions of above - solar metallicity and only if high - density gas is present ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) . this scenario could be applicable to some `` type 2 '' liners which do not show any clear signs of nonstellar activity .",

organize into the desired structures @xcite . a well - known and widely explored possibility to induce \n this self - organization is to use the capillarity forces which appear during the drying of a liquid suspension of nanoparticles @xcite . \n for instance , regular and irregular two - dimensional polystyrene nanosphere arrays on silica substrates are generated by such methods @xcite . \n these patterns are used then as a convenient mask in the nanosphere litography ( nsl ) method . \n carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) are attractive materials for nanotechnology because of their interesting physico - chemical properties and molecular symmetries . in order to make them appropriate for certain applications , \n proper initial cnt configurations have to be built , and specific conditions have to be found which enable their controlled self - organization @xcite . \n this is a very ambitious and challenging task , which can be made easier by elaborating working computer models for the self - organization of cnts on substrates . \n therefore , not only experimental , but also computational studies can advance the field of nanoengineering .    in the work of chakrapani et al . \n @xcite an experimental procedure is presented in which capillary self - organization of cnts leads to puzzling cellular patterns . after the collapse and reassembly of the highly ordered , anisotropic , elastic cnts , shrinkage and crack formation occurs . \n the resulting cellular foams are visually striking , stable patterns .    , width=283 ]    the experimental procedure @xcite may be shortly summarized as follows . \n multi - walled nanotube arrays are grown on rigid silica surface by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) based on the decomposition of ferrocene and xylene . \n the resulting nanotubes have a wall thickness of ca . \n 10 nm and a diameter of ca . \n 30 nm . \n the average distance between two nanotubes is ca . \n 50 nm . \n the obtained nanotube bristle is oxidized in an oxygen plasma at room temperature and 133 pa pressure for 10 minutes and immersed in a wetting fluid . \n after the liquid evaporates , characteristic cellular type patterns are formed , i.e. the ends of nanotubes self - organize in compact walls . \n figure [ fig1 ] . shows scanning electron microscope images of some typical structures . from the figures we learn that a wide variety of structures are engineered in such manner . \n both statistically symmetric polygonal cells and rather elongated ones can be obtained by chaning the experimental conditions . \n these micrometer scale structures have many advantageous features . \n they can be elastically deformed , transferred to other substrates or floated out to produce free - standing macroscopic fabrics . \n thus , they might find potential applications as shock absorbent reinforcement in nanofiltration devices , elastic membranes and fabrics , and containers for storage or growth of biological cells . \n despite of its applications and the existence of well elaborated production protocols , the exact mechanisms responsible for self - organization of cnts into vertically aligned cellular structures is not clearly understood . \n recently , it has been argued that although we lack some basic information regarding the self - organization of cnts within a bristle , this process can be approximated with the self - organization of arrays of cnt micropillars of micron - scale diameters @xcite each consisting of thousands of cnts . \n this observation enables the construction of a computationally tractable model which operates instead of stand - alone cnts with micropillars .    in the present work a simple mechanical spring - block type model defined at mesoscopic micropillar level is considered for understanding the capillarity driven self - organization of nanobristles ( or so called `` cnt forests '' ) . \n the aim is to build a model that is able to qualitatively reproduce the variety of experimentally produced patterns . \n the model used here for describing the self - organization process of nanobristles is a mesoscopic one and is based on the mechanical spring - block stick - slip model family . \n this model family appeared in 1967 , when r. burridge and l. knopoff @xcite constructed a simple mechanical model for explaining the guttenberg - richter law for the distribution of earthquakes after their magnitude . \n the basic elements of the model are blocks and springs that interconnect in a lattice - like topology . \n the blocks can slide with friction on a planar surface . \n the original system introduced by burridge and knopoff ( bk ) is a one - dimensional model . \n it can be studied numerically and it exhibits self - organized criticality @xcite . \n the bk model gained new perspectives with the strong development of computers and computer simulation methods . \n variants of the bk model proved to be useful in describing complex phenomena where avalanche - like processes are present , pattern formation phenomena and mesoscopic processes in solid - state physics or material sciences @xcite .    recently , by using this model , we have succesfully explained the patterns obtained in capillary self - organization of nanospheres @xcite . \n motivated by this success , hereby we propose to map the capillarity driven self - organization of nanotube bristles to a spring - block system , and to understand the pattern selection process by means of computer simulations . \n , width=283 ]    first , let us consider the three - dimensional ( 3d ) model , which is very similar to the real nanotube arrangement . \n as sketched in figure [ fig2](a ) , the micropillars composed by thousands of nanotubes having fixed bottom ends are modeled by flexible strands . \n their capillary interactions are represented by non - classical springs that connect the neighboring pillars . \n the evaporation of the liquid is simulated by the stepwise increase of tension in the springs . \n this will result in the agglomeration of micropillar ends creating the final structure in the studied system .    as shown in figure [ fig2](b ) , this 3d model can be easily mapped into a two - dimensional ( 2d ) one by projecting the micropillars top ends on the surface . in the projection plane \n the micropillars bottom ends are represented as dots , and their positions are fixed on a predefined lattice . \n the movable top ends are modeled by the disk shaped blocks which can slide with friction on the 2d simulation surface . for visual purposes only , each block is connected by an extensible string with its bottom end showing the micropillars trunk . in our simplest approach there is no restriction imposed to the length of these extensible strings which means that nanotubes with infinite length are used . \n this corresponds to the real case when the nanotubes length is much grater than the linear size of the cells in the final patterns . \n the blocks ( top of micropillars ) are connected with their nearest neighbors through special springs that model the resulting forces acting between the micropillars . \n .[fig3 ]    these special springs are one key ingredient of our computational model . \n they represent the resultant interaction force acting between two micropillars immersed in suspension . \n the tension force in the spring has a complex variation with the spring - length , it s form is sketched with a red line in the top panel of figure [ fig3 ] . \n this force is the resultant of the capillary force , the electrostatic repulsion and the van der waals attraction between the micropillars . \n the form of the capillary force acting between two micro - scale rods wetted by a liquid was measured experimentally and deduced analytically , too @xcite . \n electrostatic repulsion and van der waals attraction are successfully described by the derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek theory @xcite . \n the capillary force decays inversely proportionally with distance @xmath0 . \n the resultant of all these forces reduces to zero for long distances and it has a maximum @xmath1 at distance @xmath2 of micropillars . \n our model approximates this resulting force . the special spring - force used in simulations \n is shown with solid line in the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] . for small elongations \n @xmath3 this spring acts as a classical spring with @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the spring constant and @xmath6 is its equilibrium length . for elongations \n longer than @xmath2 the spring force decays as @xmath7 where the constant @xmath8 is selected in such way that the force - elongation curve is continuous at @xmath2 . \n the maximum of the spring force at @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath1 . \n similarly with our previous models of drying granular materials @xcite or self - organizing nanosphere systems @xcite , the effects created by the evaporation of the liquid is introduced through these springs . as the liquid evaporates the meniscus accounting for the capillarity forces gets more accentuated . \n this is modeled by a step - by - step increasing of the spring constant @xmath5 . \n it has to be noted that through the drying process the maximum force in the spring @xmath1 remains unchanged since the electrostatic forces are not affected . \n accordingly , with the increasing of @xmath5 the @xmath2 value has to be proportionally lowered . \n the second key ingredient of our spring - block model ( necessary to get realistic structures ) is the capillary force resulting from the non - vertical orientation of micropillars . \n once the micropillar becomes inclined , the meniscus radius of the liquid surface in contact with the micropillar becomes grater on the top side than on the bottom side . \n this leads to an unstable state because a resulting net force @xmath9 pointing vertically downwards will act at the crossing point between the liquid surface and the micropillar @xcite , tending to incline even more the tube . here \n we denoted by @xmath10 the angle between the vertical and the tangent to the micropillar at the liquid level .    in our spring - block approach this force which is monotonically increasing with the inclination angle \n is approximated by a simple linear repulsion force @xmath11 acting between the block and its fixed bottom end ( @xmath12 denotes their distance in the simulation plane and @xmath13 is the repulsion constant ) . \n there is an additional almost hard - core  type repulsion @xmath14 which forbids blocks to interpenetrate . \n this is taken into account by the repulsive part of a lennard  jones type force which acts only when the distance between two blocks becomes smaller than @xmath6 ( dashed line on the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] ) . \n additionally to the presented forces , damping forces are considered to stabilize the dynamics . a friction ( pinning ) between blocks and surface \n is introduced . \n it can equilibrate a net force less than @xmath15 . \n whenever the total force acting on a block exceeds @xmath15 , the block slips with an over - damped motion . \n the dynamics leading to pattern formation consists of the following relaxation steps . \n first , the system is initialized . \n blocks are placed on a triangular lattice with lattice constant @xmath16 and their corresponding bottom ends are fixed at the same positions . then , the blocks are slightly dislodged in a random direction with a small random shift not grater than the half of the empty space between blocks . \n thereby , the initial imperfectness of the nanobristle is modeled . \n next , the interconnecting spring - network is build . \n the spring constant @xmath5 is selected in such way that in the initial system the spring forces are not exceeding the pinning force @xmath15 that acts on each block . \n an initially prestressed spring - block network is thus constructed .    during each simulation \n step the spring constant is increased by a small amount @xmath17 representing the increase of tension due to the evaporation of water and the system relaxes to an equilibrium configuration . in this configuration the total net force acting on each disk is lower in magnitude than the pinning threshold @xmath15 .    similarly with the modelling of drying nanosphere suspensions @xcite , the relaxation dynamics \n is realized through an over - damped molecular dynamics simulation using a fixed time - step . \n the equilibrium state in a viscous medium can be found by moving the blocks in each simulation step in the direction of the net force acting on them , and with a displacement which is proportional to the magnitude of the resultant force @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes a viscosity .    since \n the simulation steps will be chosen small enough , this simplified dynamics is able to replace the newtonian solution without loss of significant information . \n we remind here that we are not interested in the dynamics , but in the final equilibrium configuration . \n a relaxation step is finished when no disk slipping event occurs for the given spring constant value . \n it usually takes a very long time to achieve a perfect relaxation , therefore we introduce a tolerance ( @xmath20@xmath21 ) , and assume that the relaxation is completed when the largest displacement per unit time is smaller than this value . \n after relaxation is done , we proceed to the next simulation step and increase all spring constants by @xmath17 . \n this dynamics is repeated until a final , stable configuration of the blocks is reached . \n when implementing the above relaxation dynamics , several types of boundary conditions can be considered . however , as it was shown in @xcite the boundary conditions ( free , fixed or periodic ) will influence the final stable structure only in the vicinity of boundaries . in the bulk , \n the obtained structures are rather independent of this choice . \n accordingly , in the present simulations fixed boundary conditions are used and snapshots from the bulk are taken for later investigations .    the above presented model has many parameters . here , their values for our present simulations are given . \n the disk shaped blocks are considered with radii @xmath22 , and it defines the unit length in the system . after fixing the diameter of the circular simulation area @xmath23 , \n the blocks are placed on the triangular lattice having a lattice constant @xmath24 . the density ( or space filling ) of micropillars is implicitly defined by this lattice constant . \n the block sliding dynamics is governed by the viscosity @xmath25 used in the equation ( [ overdamped ] ) and the pinning threshold @xmath26 . \n the springs used in simulations are characterized by two parameters , namely the initial spring constant @xmath27 and the equilibrium distance of springs @xmath6 . by these parameters \n the unit force in our model system is defined . in order to simulate a quasi - static drying process the spring constant increasing step \n has to be a small one @xmath28 . \n the central capillary repulsion constant @xmath29 is set to be small enough that in the initial system , where the micropillars are almost vertical , not to affect the cell formation dynamics . \n later , when the walls are forming ( and the micropillars are no longer vertically aligned ) , this force becomes grater and it helps the wall formation and stabilization process . \n the used lennard \n jones force has its standard parameters set to @xmath30 and @xmath31 expressed in simulation units . \n all results presented in the following are obtained with the above choosed parameter values , unless it is otherwise specified in figure captions .    , \n @xmath32 and @xmath33 . \n the simulation time step @xmath34 is noted below the snapshots.[fig4],width=283 ]    the presented algorithm can be easily implemented and systems up to 300000 nanotubes can be simulated in reasonable computational time . as observable from the time - sequence in figure [ fig4 ] , \n the cellular patterns are formed after nucleation of voids in the spring - block network ( time step @xmath35 ) . \n a preliminary void is enlarged by the tensioned springs ( time step @xmath36 ) until the top of micropillars arrange in a final and stable cellular structure ( time step @xmath37 ) . \n the obtained dynamics resembles the pattern formation mechanism known from experimental in - situ observations @xcite .     and @xmath38 . \n the lattice constant is @xmath39 for the top left panel , @xmath40 for the top right panel and @xmath41 for the bottom left panel . \n the obtained structures are magnified on the bottom right panel.[fig5],width=283 ]    furthermore , the effect of nanotube density on final patterns is computationally investigated . \n simulations with the same parameter set are preformed for systems initialized with different lattice constants @xmath16 . by this , the space filling of the micropillar system @xmath42 is varied . here \n , it has to be noted that the micropillar density and implicitly the micropillar lattice constant are linearly connected to the real nanotube density @xmath43 and the nanotube lattice constant @xmath44 , respectively . \n if a micropillar is composed by @xmath34 nanotubes , then by simple geometrical calculations it can be shown that @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the radius of a nanotube .    in figure [ fig5 ] three different type of simulated structures are presented . for high space filling @xmath47 corresponding to lattice constant @xmath39 polygonal cellular structures are obtained similar to those on the left hand side of figure [ fig1 ] . as one can observe on the magnified cell image , at the center there is a clean area formed by radially outgoing micropillars . for intermediate space filling @xmath48 which corresponds to a lattice constant @xmath40 the micropillars self - organize into elongated cellular structures . \n the obtained structures are in qualitative agreement with the experimental structures presented in the right hand side sem images of figure [ fig1 ] . \n when interpreting the image , one has to take into account that the length scale of this snapshot is @xmath49 times smaller than the length scale of the previously discussed one . \n accordingly , the typical size of the simulated elongated structures is @xmath50 times grater than the typical size of the polygonal structures . for low space filling @xmath51 corresponding to a lattice constant @xmath41 \n the micropillars form bundled clusters resembling the recent experimental patterns of sequential assembly of self - similar nanotube clusters @xcite .    , \n @xmath52 and @xmath33 . \n [ fig6],width=283 ]    finally our simulations explored also the possibility of designing highly ordered micropatterns in nanobristles . in this sense , an experimental procedure elaborated in the last years @xcite has been reconstructed by our spring - block type simulations . \n the design procedure is based on the experimental observation that low - density regions or vacancies in the bristle play an important role in the pattern cell nucleation process .    as shown in top panels of figure [ fig6 ] , \n different kinds of highly ordered micropatterned structures have been created by etching regular vacancies with laser pulses . \n capillary self - organization in such systems yields the structures presented on the top panels of figure [ fig6 ] . \n simulations on micropillar forests with vacancies of radius @xmath53 created on rectangular and triangular lattice have been performed . \n the results are shown on bottom panels of figure [ fig6 ] . in agreement with experimental findings \n , our spring - block simulation results suggest that various micropatterns may be designed by proper preparation of the initial nanobristle taking into account that the wall of a polygon shaped cell forms approximately at the vertical bisector of two adjacent vacancies .    in conclusion , a simple mechanical , \n spring - block type model has been proposed here to model capillarity driven self - organization of nanobristles . \n the 3d problem has been mapped to a 2d model that works at the mesoscopic micropillar level incorporating real interactions known from earlier experimental findings . \n our computer simulations evidenced the role of capillary and electrostatic forces in forming the self - organized nanostructures . \n the dynamics leading to pattern formation has been also revealed . by using the same model parameters with different nanotube densities three qualitatively different types of patterns \n were reproduced . \n moreover , the possibility of designing highly ordered nanostructures has also been explored .",

@xmath0-functions @xcite . \n a crucial feature of the examples was the necessity to introduce artificially a `` renormalised '' @xmath0-function in order to obtain the expected values for the central

additional trick because the numerical fourier transformation is not stable . \n instead the plot is generated by transforming @xmath46 multiplied by a gaussian distribution . \n this is merely a sort of cutoff and does not spoil the validity of the result as long as we are only interested in the behaviour at large @xmath30 . \n this is due to the fact that the fourier transformation just intertwines the region close to zero in @xmath30 with far from zero in @xmath50 and vice versa . \n the gaussian does not affect the behaviour of @xmath46 for small @xmath30 . \n + as a cross check

fact that we have not tabulated the transformed function on the whole real line but just on a finite interval . \n + the sharp peak in fig . \n [ figureboth ] is a complete artefact of the multiplication by the gaussian hence completely meaningless . \n the straight line in the same figure denotes the value which must be approached for @xmath50 very large in order to represent a decline in the central charge to 2/3 of the original value . with a different sampling of the data it is possible to find the right behaviour of the fourier transform for small @xmath50 , too . the result is

rich nuclei around n=20 are thought to be strongly deformed because of the reduction of the n=20 shell gap . \n the deformation in nuclei becomes more important than any other periods with the recent development of rare isotope accelerator facilities , from which one may perform lots of challenging experiments related to the exotic nuclei . \n although they decay fractions of a second , their existence is imprinted on the nuclear abundances of stars through the successive nuclear reactions in the cosmos at the explosive stage of stellar evolution , such as supernovae ( sne ) explosion @xcite . \n for example , the nuclear reactions induced by the neutrinos emitted from the sne are treated as important input data for the neutrino - process @xcite . \n since the neutrinos emitted from a proto - neutron star may have tens of mev energy high enough to excite the deformed nuclei , one needs to understand more precisely the high - lying ( hl ) excited states beyond one nucleon threshold . among them , \n the gt states are of great importance because most of the charge exchange reactions are dominated by the gt transition . \n these hl gt excited states are in close association with the nuclear structure . \n one of typical instances is the gt quenching problem . \n it says that the difference of total running sums @xmath7 for gt ( @xmath8 ) transitions , @xmath9 , is usually quenched compared to the ikeda sum rule ( isr ) , @xmath10 . \n but , recent experimental data on hl gt states deduced by more energetic projectiles shed a new light on the gt states located above one nucleon threshold , whose contributions enable us to explain the quenching problem through the multi - particle and multi - hole configuration mixing @xcite .    in order to describe neutron - rich nuclei and their relevant nuclear reactions occurred in the nuclear processes , one needs to develop theoretical frameworks including explicitly the deformation @xcite . \n ref . \n @xcite used an effective separable force to the deformed quasi - particle random phase approximation ( dqrpa ) . \n realistic two - body interaction was firstly exploited at ref . \n @xcite .    in this paper \n , we apply our previous dqrpa @xcite to the nuclei in the n=20 inversion island . starting from the deformed wood saxon potential @xcite , \n we transform a physical state given by the diagonalization of total hamiltonian in the nilsson basis into the spherical basis , in which one can perform more easily theoretical calculations . \n then , _ ab initio _ brueckner g - matrix calculated in the spherical basis is represented in terms of the deformed basis , which enables us to solve the deformed bcs in the following way .    with the expansion coefficient @xmath11 from the deformed to the spherical basis , @xmath12 with @xmath13 , the pairing potential @xmath14 between a @xmath15 and its time conjugate state @xmath16 \n is calculated as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is introduced for the transformation to the deformed basis of g - matrix . \n here @xmath19 , which is a projection number of the total angular momentum @xmath20 onto the @xmath21 axis , is selected @xmath22 at the bcs stage because we consider the pairings of the quasi - particles at @xmath15 and @xmath23 states . in order to renormalize the g - matrix , strength parameters , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 \n are multiplied to the g - matrix @xcite .     from the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) ( upper panel ) and from the b(e2 ) \n data @xcite ( lower panel ) tabulated in table i. since all @xmath27 values in the upper panel are zero , spses by deformed basis are degenerated into spherical basis , whose degeneracy is explained in the legend of right hand side . \n detailed evolutions from the degeneracy by the deformation are shown in the lower panel . \n the inside box in the lower panel stands for @xmath28 intruder region.,title=\"fig : \" ]   from the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) ( upper panel ) and from the b(e2 ) data @xcite ( lower panel ) tabulated in table i. since all @xmath27 values in the upper panel are zero , spses by deformed basis are degenerated into spherical basis , whose degeneracy is explained in the legend of right hand side . \n detailed evolutions from the degeneracy by the deformation are shown in the lower panel . the inside box in the lower panel stands for @xmath28 intruder region.,title=\"fig : \" ]     in table ii.,title=\"fig : \" ]   in table ii.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the @xmath29 transition amplitudes from the ground state of an initial nucleus to the excited state \n are expressed by @xmath30 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the nomalization factor and @xmath32 denotes the correlated qrpa ground state in the intrinsic frame .    to compare to the experimental data , the gt(@xmath8 ) strength functions @xmath33 and their running sums @xmath34 \n are evaluated . \n the single particle states are used up to @xmath35 in the spherical limit . \n since the gt strength distributions turn out to be sensitive on the deformation parameter , @xmath36 @xcite , we took @xmath36 values from both the relativistic mean field ( rmf)@xcite and the e2 transition data , @xmath37^{1/2}(r_0=1.2a^{1/3})$]@xcite . in order to compare our single particle state energies ( spses ) of n = 20 nuclei to those by other nuclear models , which show the shell evolution , we plotted spses in fig . \n 1 , whose deformation parameters are tabulated in table i.    the level density of _ fp _ shell at the upper panel in fig.1 is increased with the decrease of proton number similarly to the result of ref . \n @xcite which exploited hf with skyrme interactions ( see fig . 2 at ref . \n @xcite ) in the qrpa scheme to study the first @xmath38 states in @xmath2 mg and @xmath39ne . \n this trend becomes manifest if we use the e2 deformation parameter ( lower panel ) . \n of course , the increased level density may lead to the anomaly of the b(e2 ) values as shown in ref . @xcite . \n in particular , n=20 shell gap is explicitly broken with the decrease of proton number by the intruder of @xmath4 state below @xmath6 state . \n note the inside box in fig . \n 1(b ) , where ( 330 1/2 ) state from @xmath4 state is located below ( 202 3/2 ) and ( 200 1/2 ) states from @xmath6 state at z = 10 and 12 region . \n recent calculation by the shell model ( see fig . \n 3 ( a ) at ref . \n @xcite ) also shows such a trend , although the effect itself was smaller than ours . \n .deformation parameters @xmath36 of n=20 isotones from rmf @xcite and b(e2)@xcite for n=20 isotones . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : isotope ]    these shell evolution phenomena by the intruder are intimately related to the following facts . \n the spses adopted from the deformed woods saxon potential naturally depend on the parameter @xmath36 . \n the deformation of nuclei may be conjectured to come from macroscopic phenomena , for example , the core polarization , the high spin states and so on . \n microscopic reasons may be traced to the tensor force in nucleon - nucleon interaction , which is known to account for the shell evolution according to the recent shell model calculations @xcite . \n for example , t = 0 , j = 1 pairing , which is associated with the @xmath40 tensor force , may lead to the deformation compared to the t = 1 , j = 0 pairing . \n therefore , the deformation parameter adopted in this work may include implicitly and effectively such effects , because the single particle states from the deformed wood saxon potential show strong dependences on the @xmath36 , as shown in figs . 1 and 2 . \n now we discuss the gt strengths on mg isotopes whose spses heavily depend on the neutron numbers as shown in fig . \n 2 . in particular , @xmath2 mg is thought to locate in the island inversion . since the nuclei considered here are expected to have large energy gaps between proton and neutron spaces , similarly to the neutron - rich nuclei of importance in the r - process , we consider only the @xmath41 and @xmath42 pairing correlation , which have only isospin t = 1 and j = 0 interaction .    ) on mg isotopes as a function of the excitation energy @xmath43 w.r.t . \n the ground state of @xmath39 mg @xmath44 mg with the deformation parameter @xmath27 at the upper panel in fig . \n 2 . ]     used at the lower panel in fig . \n 2 . ]    in fig . \n 3 , the gt strength distributions by @xmath27 , b(gt@xmath45 ) , on mg isotopes are presented as a function of the excitation energy @xmath43 w.r.t . the ground state of @xmath39 mg @xmath44 mg for @xmath27 values \n @xcite . \n the gt strength distributions are widely scattered into the hl states owing to the deformation . actually , these hl gt states are intimately associated with the 2p-2h contributions which result from the wide smearing of some physical states around the fermi surface by the prolate deformation @xcite . \n fig.4 is the results by @xmath46 , which shows an interesting point . \n some low - lying gt states below 5 mev disappeared if we use @xmath46 values .     for two dominant gt states w.r.t . \n the ground state of @xmath2 mg as a function of the configuration state for the case of fig.4 ( b ) . ]    this can be explained if we recollect the disappearance of the magic number @xmath47 in fig.2(b ) . for detailed analysis , in fig.5 \n , we identify main collective @xmath48 states for the gt transitions on @xmath2 mg for @xmath49 , which are presented as @xmath50 of two excitation energies having relatively larger b(gt ) values in fig.4 ( b ) . \n @xmath51 is a forward(backward ) amplitude in eq . \n ( 2 ) . \n the transition at 7.44 mev in k = 1 come from the combination of two ( 2001/2 ) states and the transition at 10.18 mev turns out to come from the combination of ( 2203/2 ) and ( 2025/2 ) sates . an important point to be noticed in fig.5 is that the ( 2001/2 ) state stemming from the @xmath6 state may contribute to the gt transition at 7.44 mev by the @xmath28 intruder state . \n these hl gt states , which were usually not considered because of the limited models space in theoretical side and the limited incident energy of projectiles in experimental side , enable us to abandon the quenching factor for the ikeda sum rule and to take into account of hl gt states in the neutrino - induced reaction , in particular , by the supernova neutrino , whose energy range may extend up to tens of mev @xcite .    in summary , to describe single particle states in deformed basis , we exploited the deformed axially symmetric woods - saxon potential , and performed the deformed bcs and deformed qrpa with the realistic two - body interaction recalculated in deformed basis from _ ab initio _ g - matrix based on bonn cd potential . \n results of the gamow - teller strength for mg isotopes show that the deformation effect leads to a fragmentation of the gt strength into hl states and predicts the hl gt excitations to be explored by higher energy projectiles , whose excitations may affect the neutrino process in the cosmos through the gt transition . \n they are shown to result from the wide smearing by the increase of the fermi surface energy due to the prolate deformation .    in order to properly describe the deformed nuclei , in particular , located near to stability region , the t= 0 and j = 1 _ np _ \n pairing should be also taken into account because the j = 1 pairing is believed as one of the reasons leading to the nuclear deformation . also , for the p - process nuclei , \n the _ np _ pairing could be more important than the neutron - rich nuclei because of the adjacent energy gaps of protons and neutrons . \n the calculations for the neutron - deficient nuclei in the p - process are in progress . \n since the continuum states are of importance in neutron - rich nuclei , we are also preparing to include the continuum states in the present deformed qrpa . \n this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea ( 2012r1a1a3009733 , 2012 -

linear magnetic system with a strongly periodic current can show behavior similar to that of sr but only for frequencies below the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) frequency of the system . \n such a phenomena can provide an effective way to suppress low frequency noise in spin valve magnetic sensors . \n the application of stochastic resonance @xcite to increase the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) is now well established in many physical systems @xcite and has also been shown to increase the stability of an unstable system in some cases @xcite . \n particle production in a quantum field can also be enhanced in the presence of noise @xcite . \n the snr is enhanced by adding noise to the system as it is being driven by an external periodic force . \n however until now only one - dimensional systems with additive noise and a simple bistable potential , e.g. , @xmath0 , or a potential with one metastable state , e.g. , @xmath1 , have been studied and shown to have this interesting property of increasing the snr with the addition of noise as it is being driven by a time - dependent force . \n this counter intuitive response is inherently related to the non - linearities present in these systems . \n one might therefore ask if a similar behavior can be found in more complicated systems , in particular magnetic systems .  in this letter , we give one example of such systems ; a spin valve of two magnetic layers separated by a normal conductor . \n the magnetization is inhomogeneous in the free layer and a current perpendicular to the plane ( cpp ) traverses the structure .  in this case \n a spin torque between the layers can exist and will play in the following an important role in the sr effect .    until recently , \n the ideas of stochastic resonance have not been exploited in magnetic systems . \n as far as i know , reference @xcite provides the only application we are aware of ; it applies sr to the measurement of hysteresis loops in magnetic systems described by preisach model .  in the following , we study a magnetic system with multiplicative noise and show that a stochastic resonance type behavior exist in this system and can be taken advantage of to _ selectively _ suppress frequencies from the noise spectrum . \n the system we treat is very realistic and hence more complex than previously treated systems @xcite . \n the use of strong time - dependent currents implies that our system is in a non - equilibrium state and linear response methods are obsolete for our study @xcite . \n in this letter we will attempt only a qualitative treatment of this subject aided by numerical integration of the non - linear landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation @xcite . \n we study a current perpendicular to the plane ( cpp ) spin valve with two magnetic layers ( fig . \n [ geometry ] ) , one with magnetization @xmath2 pinned along the x - axis ( reference layer rl ) while the other layer ( fl ) has a free magnetization @xmath3 . \n figure [ zerocurrent ] shows the power spectral densities ( psd ) of the thre components of the magnetization in the absence of current . \n the psd s have been normalized the same way in all the figures . \n the noise in the z component is smallest due to the demagnetization field . \n the current has an ac component in addition to the dc component . \n the source of noise in the system is due to thermal fluctuations that activates switching between two states and hence it is intrinsic to the system .  to get an energy surface with more than one local minimum \n , we bias the spin valve with an external field that is close to being perpendicular to the fixed magnetization of the rl and take into account spin momentum transfer effects @xcite between the two layers of the spin valve . \n the y - component of the external field is kept at @xmath4 while the one along @xmath5 is kept around @xmath6 . \n the layers have dimensions @xmath7 with the easy axis along the x - axis and anisotropy @xmath8 . \n the magnetization in the pinned layer is fixed by a large bias field .  hence , in this study the pinned layer is studied micromagnetically on equal footing with the free layer . \n the magnetization in this structure shows two configurations ( fig . \n [ config ] ) which are non - homogeneous and are a result of the demagnetization field , the current field and any interaction between the layers @xcite . \n in addition to stable and unstable states , the system has saddle points which are present due to the spin torque term . \n spin valve structures are useful components of giant magneto - resistance ( gmr ) sensor devices and hence the manifestations of stochastic resonance in these systems may be of practical importance .  to increase the sensitivity of a gmr sensor , the bias field on the free layer is almost perpendicular to the magnetization of the pinned layer .  it is this kind of biasing that gives rise to the @xmath9-type noise studied here since it permits the system to hop between two - states \n .  the results reported here are valid even if the pinning of the bottom layer is not perfect . \n in fact , large bias fields tend to distort the magnetization in the pinned layer but only slightly and will not contribute to the 1/f - type noise observed here . \n to analyze this system , we use the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation @xcite supplemented by the spin torque as first suggested by slonczweski @xcite ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath12 is the damping constant taken here to be equal to 0.01 . \n the effective field @xmath13 includes exchange interactions , anisotropy , the demagnetization field and the field from the current . \n the interlayer exchange is assumed small of the order of @xmath14 . \n the value of @xmath12 chosen is larger than typical values of damping in the bulk of a permalloy .  in a geometry such as ours , \n the damping is dominated by interfacial damping and 0.01 is a reasonable value for it @xcite . \n the noise is assumed white gaussian , @xmath15 with @xmath16 and using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) , @xmath17 is proportional to the temperature @xmath18 and inversely proportional to the volume @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xcite . \n however , as we have shown in @xcite , in the presence of a bias voltage the fdt is strictly not applicable unless we restrict our region of interest to frequencies close to the fmr frequency of the system .  in the following , \n we assume that fdt is still applicable . \n @xmath21 is the direction of the magnetization in the rl . \n the current @xmath22 has one static component and another one with frequency @xmath23 . \n the form of the spin torque in the presence of ac currents still has the same form as in the slonczewski equation . \n zhu et al . \n @xcite calculated the ac spin torque in a magnetic tunnel junctions and found it to be very close in form to the static case .  among other things \n , they found that at low frequencies , the total spin torque can become less than the spin torque of the static component of the current . \n hence an ac current can introduce a partial self - cancellation of the spin torque . \n therefore we expect the ac spin torque to affect the noise spectrum of a magnetic system in a nontrivial way . \n the noise or spectral density functions of the system are calculated numerically since for time dependent systems the fluctuation dissipation relations are invalid @xcite . \n the current flows along the z - direction perpendicular to the xy plane of the magnetic layers . \n the magnetization of the rl is fixed along the x - direction . \n the fmr frequency for this system is around @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \n the constant @xmath26 .  in magnetic recording , e.g . \n , such devices operate at frequencies below the fmr frequency and hence this system is considered noisy to be useful as a sensor .  one possible way to address this problem is to seek a way to suppress the noise for frequencies less than @xmath27 and may be shift the noise to higher frequencies which is outside the operational range of the device . \n in this sense we are selectively suppressing the noise below the fmr frequency only . \n previous applications of stochastic resonance were interested in suppressing the noise around the frequency of the driving force which is usually the signal to be measured .    from fig.[xac0 ] , we observe that it is the x - component of the magnetization of the fl that is the noisiest and hence this would interfere with the gmr signal . \n the out - of plane z - component of the magnetization is very quiet due to the demagnetization field . \n fig . \n [ xtac0 ] shows that the source of the noise is from the switching of the magnetization between two configurations . \n one with an average x - component of about @xmath28 and the other less stable one with an average x - component around @xmath29 .  the spectral noise in the y and z components show more than the usual fmr peak since the system is not in equilibrium . \n the higher order harmonics are due to non - homogeneity of the magnetization , i.e. , spin waves .    in fig . \n [ xt5nac0 ] , we change the sign of the current to show the effect of the spin torque on the magnetization and noise .  in this case \n , the magnetization spends almost equal time in both states . \n this suggests the use of the spin torque itself as a regulator of the transition rate between two bistable states .  in this letter \n , we will not pursue this idea further and instead we want to explore the idea of adding a strongly periodic current in addition to the dc bias current in order to suppress the noise for frequencies below @xmath27 . \n figure [ xac5 ] shows the result of applying an ac current with amplitude equal to the bias current and a frequency of about @xmath30 for the same system of fig . [ xac0 ] . \n the noise spectrum for frequencies below @xmath31 is greatly suppressed by this additional current source . \n however now the peak around the fmr frequency is much more pronounced and so does its width . \n the second narrow peak is that of the ac current .  a closer look at the real time behavior of the x - component of the magnetization , fig . \n [ xac5 t ] , implies that the original energy barrier is no longer present . \n the strong periodic current which in turn induces a periodic spin torque is driving the system and making it less sensitive to random thermal fluctuations which are the source of the low frequency .  to be an effective suppressant , the frequency of the torque has to be outside the bandwidth of the sensor device . \n finally , fig . \n [ xac0ht1 ] shows that an increase in the frequency of the ac current degrades the effectiveness of the ac current component to suppress the low frequency noise . \n we found for this example , that for current amplitudes at @xmath32 , the maximum frequency the current should have is about twice the fmr frequency of the system . \n this latter criterion seems to depend strongly on the energy surface and hence there is no universal behavior as in the bistable one dimensional well where the frequency of the driving force is the inverse of twice the inter - well transition time .    in summary \n , we have shown that the ideas of sr are still attractive even for complex systems which can not be described by a one dimensional potential .  in higher dimensions and in the presence of a spin torque , \n saddle point states become available to the system and may invalidate the ideas of stochastic resonance .  in this letter \n , we showed that a strongly periodic current can suppress thermally induced jumps between a stable and a metastable state and hence suppresses the low frequency noise and enhance the fmr peak in the spin valve . \n _ this work is based on work done in the fall of 2004 at seagate research and will not be published elsewhere . \n it is merely a compilation of numerical observations . \n the author hopes to convince others that there is an interesting interplay of noise and time - dependent spin torques in cpp spin valves that is worth exploring in a more systematic way than attempted here . _",

    "newtonian limit of extended theories of gravity ( in particular , higher  order and scalar  tensor theories ) is theoretically discussed taking into account recent observational and experimental results . \n extended theories of gravity have become a sort of paradigm in the study of gravitational interaction since several motivations push for enlarging the traditional scheme of einstein general relativity . \n such issues come , essentially , from cosmology and quantum field theory . in the first case \n , it is well known that higher  derivative theories and scalar  tensor theories furnish inflationary cosmological solutions capable , in principle , of solving the shortcomings of the standard cosmological model . \n besides , they have relevant features also from the quantum cosmology viewpoint . in the second case , \n every unification scheme as superstrings , supergravity or grand unified theories , takes into account effective actions where nonminimal couplings to the geometry or higher  order terms in the curvature invariants come out . \n such contributions are due to one  loop or higher  loop corrections in the high  curvature regimes near the full ( not yet available ) quantum gravity regime . in the weak \n limit approximation , all these classes of theories should be expected to reproduce the einstein general relativity which , in any case , is experimentally tested only in this limit . \n this fact is matter of debate since several relativistic theories do not reproduce the einstein results in the newtonian approximation . \n for example , some authors claim for explaining the flat rotation curves of galaxies by yukawa  like corrections to the newtonian potential arising in this context . \n others have shown that a conformal theory of gravity could explain the missing matter problem . \n moreover , indications of an apparent , anomalous , long  range acceleration revealed from the data analysis of pioneer 10/11 , galileo , and ulysses spacecrafts could be framed in a general theoretical scheme by taking into account yukawa  like or higher  order corrections to the newtonian potential . \n such data will be very likely capable of confirming or ruling out the physical consistency of extended theories of gravity . \n 8.5 in 5.5 in -.25 in    = = = = = = =    = = =    v ( ) l    = = = = = = =    = = =    # 1@xmath0    = = = = = =    =    =    _astron \n . astrophys . \n _     v ( ) l    keyword(s ) : extended theories of gravity , weak - field approximation , newtonian limit .",

    "we study the gluonic phase in a two - flavor color superconductor as a function of the ratio of the gap over the chemical potential mismatch , @xmath0 . \n we find that the gluonic phase resolves the chromomagnetic instability encountered in a two - flavor color superconductor for @xmath1 . \n we also calculate approximately the free energies of the gluonic phase and the single plane - wave loff phase and show that the former is favored over the latter for a wide range of coupling strengths . \n it is widely accepted that sufficiently cold and dense quark matter is a color superconductor @xcite . the most likely and , probably , the only place where color superconductivity can exist in the universe is the interior of compact stars . \n thus , studies of phases of quark matter under conditions realized in the bulk of compact stars ( i.e. , color and electric charge neutrality , and @xmath2-equilibrium ) have recently attracted a great deal of interest . \n the density regime of relevance for compact stars is up to a few times the normal nuclear density @xmath3 . in this `` moderate '' density regime , \n the studies of qcd - motivated effective theories are most useful and have revealed a rich phase structure @xcite . \n one of the most striking features of neutral and @xmath2-equilibrated color - superconducting phases is unconventional cross - flavor cooper pairing of quarks with the possibility of gapless superconductivity , e.g. , in the form of the gapless 2sc ( g2sc ) phase @xcite or the gapless color - flavor - locked ( gcfl ) phase @xcite . \n it was , however , quickly realized that the 2sc / g2sc phases suffer from a chromomagnetic instability , indicated by imaginary meissner screening masses of some gluons @xcite . \n in the 2sc phase , these instabilities occur when the ratio of the gap over the mismatch of the chemical potential , @xmath4 , decreases below a value @xmath5 . \n similar instabilities were found also in the gcfl phase @xcite .    resolving the chromomagnetic instability and clarifying the nature of the true ground state of dense quark matter are the most pressing tasks in the study of color superconductors . \n it was proposed that the chromomagnetic instability in two - flavor quark matter can be removed by the formation of a single plane - wave loff state @xcite ( first studied by larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite , and fulde and ferrell @xcite in the context of solid state physics , and by alford , bowers , and rajagopal @xcite for cold , dense quark matter ) , or a gluonic phase with vector condensation in the ground state @xcite . \n ( for a recent discussion of this issue , see also refs . \n @xcite . ) \n alternatives include a mixed phase @xcite and , in the case of three - flavor quark matter , also phases with spontaneously induced meson supercurrents @xcite . \n while the neutral loff state is free from the chromomagnetic instability in the weak - coupling regime @xcite , this is , in fact , not the case for somewhat larger values of the coupling @xcite . at the same time , the gluonic phase can resolve the instability there . \n so far , however , the gluonic phase phase has been studied only around the critical point @xmath6 @xcite .    the gluonic phase and \n the loff phases are currently viewed as the most likely candidates for resolving the chromomagnetic instability and , thus , for the true ground state of two - flavor color - superconducting quark matter . \n ( here we exclude the possibility of phase separation @xcite which may have limitations of its own and deserves a separate in - depth study . ) in order to see which of the two proposed phases is actually preferred , one first has to extend the analysis of ref . \n @xcite to a computation of the free energy away from the critical point @xmath6 , and then compare the results to the free energy of the single - plane loff state . \n this is done in the present work . \n we qualitatively confirm the results of ref . \n @xcite and extend them by ( approximately ) including the neutrality condition and explicitly comparing the free energy of the gluonic phase to that of the single plane - wave loff phase as a function of the coupling strength .    in order to study various phases of two - flavor quark matter , we use a gauged nambu \n jona - lasinio ( njl ) model with massless up and down quarks : @xmath7 where the quark field @xmath8 carries flavor ( @xmath9 with @xmath10 ) and color ( @xmath11 with @xmath12 ) indices , @xmath13 is the charge conjugation matrix ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the antisymmetric tensors in flavor and color spaces , respectively . \n the covariant derivative and the field strength tensor are defined as    @xmath16    to evaluate loop diagrams we use a three - momentum cutoff @xmath17 . \n hence , the model has two phenomenological model parameters , the cutoff @xmath17 and the diquark coupling @xmath18 . \n we use @xmath19  mev throughout this paper , but we consider @xmath18 as a free parameter . henceforth , in order to specify the diquark coupling we use @xmath20 which is the value of the 2sc gap at @xmath21 ( see below ) .    in @xmath2-equilibrated neutral 2sc / g2sc matter \n , the elements of the diagonal matrix of quark chemical potentials @xmath22 are given by    @xmath23    with @xmath24 in a gauge theory , the self - consistent solution of the yang - mills equations requires background gauge fields @xcite . \n these can be viewed as electric- and color - chemical potentials which ensure electric and color - charge neutrality of the system . \n note that a generalization of this holds true even in the case of inhomogeneous phases . \n then , of course , the corresponding fields would not be constant in space . \n instead , they would have a constant central value contribution and , on top of it , a coordinate - dependent modulation describing color - electric fields induced by the inhomogeneities . \n the constant contribution would take care of the _ global _ neutrality , while the modulation describes the local field needed to prevent the _ local _ flow of currents .    on the other hand , in njl - type models without dynamic gauge fields , one has to ensure electric and color - charge neutrality by introducing appropriate chemical potentials by hand @xcite . in the case of the 2sc / g2sc phases , \n we only require an electron chemical potential @xmath25 , and a color - chemical potential @xmath26 which ensures that the color - charge density @xmath27 is zero . in principle , \n in other phases like the gluonic phase one has to check that no other color - charge density is non - vanishing and necessitates the introduction of a respective color - chemical potential . \n indeed , the gluonic phase introduced in ref . \n @xcite requires a non - vanishing temporal component of the gluon field of the third color , @xmath28 . in our gauged njl model , \n this is equivalent to a non - vanishing color - chemical potential @xmath29 besides @xmath26 . in this first exploratory study \n , however , we use the fact that both @xmath29 and @xmath26 are known to be numerically small and we simply neglect them .    in nambu - gorkov space , the inverse full quark propagator @xmath30 is written as @xmath31 with    @xmath32    and @xmath33 here @xmath34 is a matrix in flavor space . following the usual convention \n , we choose the diquark condensate to point in the third ( blue ) direction in color space .    in the one - loop approximation , \n the free energy of two - flavor quark matter at @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where `` det '' stands for the determinant in dirac , flavor , color , and nambu - gorkov space . \n unlike the free energy in ref . \n @xcite , eq .  ( [ eqn : omega1 ] ) does not have a quartic term in @xmath37 . \n this is because we neglected the color - chemical potential @xmath26 and , in addition , we take into account only one dynamic gluonic field ( see below ) .    in the gluonic phase @xcite , the chromomagnetic instability at @xmath38 triggers a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value of the spatial component of @xmath39 ( for a simpler version of such a phenomenon , see also ref . \n @xcite . ) using the @xmath40 rotational symmetry and the @xmath41 color symmetry , one can choose @xmath42 without loss of generality . \n consequently , the non - zero vacuum expectation value of @xmath43 breaks @xmath40 , leaving only @xmath44 @xcite . \n furthermore , a non - vanishing @xmath43 together with @xmath45 and @xmath25 breaks the original symmetry of qcd down to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a subgroup of the @xmath48 chiral symmetry and the charge @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the flavor matrix of the electric charges of quarks . \n the reduced symmetry of the ground state with @xmath52 allows for additional condensates , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . \n in fact , as discussed in ref . \n @xcite , such condensates are required by the equation of motion . \n as discussed above , the gluonic field @xmath55 is nothing but a color chemical potential @xmath29 . \n the field @xmath13 , on the other hand , induces electric superconductivity in the ground state and , therefore , is physically more interesting . \n however , including all three gluonic fields makes the analysis quite involved . in this work , we retain only the @xmath43 field that is directly connected to the meissner masses of gluons 47 and , thus , is the most relevant field for the chromomagnetic instability . \n it is straightforward to show that the mass of the @xmath43 field at @xmath56 ( i.e. , in the 2sc / g2sc phases ) coincides with the meissner screening masses of gluons of adjoint color 47 calculated in the hard -

wave loff pairing . in eq . \n ( [ eq : appomega ] ) , the 2sc / g2sc part of the free energy is obtained by taking the @xmath81 limit . \n also a non - zero color chemical potential @xmath26 has been neglected there . \n the free energy of a given phase can be computed by solving the gap equations , e.g. , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and the neutrality condition @xmath84 . to simplify the calculations in the gluonic phase , \n we evaluate the free energy approximately as follows : ( i ) we obtain @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the 2sc / g2sc phase by solving the coupled set of equations @xmath82 and @xmath84 , ( ii ) by using these solutions , we calculate @xmath87 which is an approximate value for the free energy in the gluonic phase . for the densities of interests , @xmath43 is at most of the order of 100 mev , whereas @xmath88 is of the order of tens of mev . \n we performed a preliminary test of the quality of our approximation by varying @xmath43 from 0 to 300 mev and computing the value of @xmath89 necessary to ensure electric neutrality . \n we found that this value changes at most by 10% . \n we illustrate the comparison of the free energies of all three phases in fig . \n [ figure3 ] ( cf . \n fig .  2 in ref . \n @xcite ) . \n we take @xmath90  mev and choose the normal phase as a reference point for the free energy . in ref . \n @xcite , it has been demonstrated that the neutral loff state is more stable than the 2sc / g2sc phases in the whole loff window @xmath91 , which includes the entire g2sc window @xmath92 . \n however , \n whereas the meissner masses squared of gluons 47 in the weakly coupled neutral loff state are positive @xcite , they remain negative in the intermediate and the strongly coupled regimes ( at all values of @xmath20 above 81  mev ) @xcite . \n in contrast , the gluonic phase removes the instability and is energetically favored over the 2sc / g2sc phases in the whole window in which the instability takes place ( at all values of @xmath0 below @xmath5 ) . \n the gluonic phase and the neutral loff state coexist in the region @xmath93 , but , as our results indicate , the gluonic phase is more stable than the neutral loff state in a wide region @xmath94  mev , which is close to the edge of the g2sc window with the normal phase . \n we argue therefore that the instability in the 2sc / g2sc phase is resolved by the formation of the gluonic phase .    . \n the three dots on the bold solid line ( @xmath95  mev from left to right ) denote the edge of the g2sc window with the normal phase , the phase transition point between 2sc and g2sc phases ( @xmath96 ) , and the critical point of the chromomagnetic instability ( @xmath97 ) . \n the quark chemical potential is taken to be @xmath90  mev.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in summary , we explored the gluonic phase away from the critical point @xmath60 . \n we demonstrated that the energetically favored state of a neutral two - flavor color superconductor is not the 2sc / g2sc phase in the intermediate- and strong - coupling regimes but the gluonic phase in which the dynamic gluonic field @xmath98 acquires a vacuum expectation value . \n in particular , the whole g2sc phase is replaced by the gluonic phase which is chromomagnetically stable . \n we also compared the free energies of the 2sc / g2sc phase , the neutral loff state , and the gluonic phase . \n we found that the gluonic phase is energetically favored in the intermediate- and strong - coupling regimes . \n the encouraging results of this analysis should be further improved in the future by ( i ) taking into account the most general ansatz for the gauge - field configuration in the gluonic phase , ( ii ) by calculating the free energy in a self - consistent manner . \n we already performed a preliminary investigation including the effect of the gluon field @xmath55 , responsible for enforcing gauss law , and found that , for @xmath99 mev , the additional cost in the free energy is of order @xmath100 , and thus negligible . \n for @xmath101 mev , however , the effect of the @xmath55 field could be an order of magnitude larger . \n it is appropriate to mention that the instability related to the 8th gluon was not studied in the present work . in this sense , \n the neutral loff state is appealing , because the meissner mass of the 8th gluon is automatically zero in this state . \n it should also be mentioned that in the strongly coupled loff state @xcite the longitudinal meissner mass squared of the 8th gluon is negative . \n although this instability was not addressed in this work , it is unlikely , however , that the loff state is energetically favored in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "we consider multilayered metamaterials comprising slightly high index inclusions ( i.e. whose permittivity is such that @xmath0 , @xmath1 is the small period to vacuum wavelength ratio ) and with low average permittivity . \n we show , by first - principles , that their optical response is driven by an unprecedented competition of first and second order spatial dispersions which are comparable due to a dramatic and non - resonant enhancement . \n such unusual competition provides various dispersion regimes supporting additional waves and topological phase transitions . \n in particular there is a novel situation where the isofrequency contour of transverse magnetic waves is bounded and disconnected . \n the proposed metamaterials are very feasible even in the optical range since , unlike high index inclusions metamaterials , they do not resort to the condition @xmath2 for enhancing second order spatial dispersion effects and can provide novel strategies for optical manipulation and steering . \n metamaterials , showing unconventional and/or tailored effective electromagnetic response , have offered a unique platform for introducing novel optical mechanisms as negative refraction , super- and hyperlensing , transformation optics , etc . @xcite . in the long - wavelength limit , metamaterial optical response is usually described through phenomenological parameters , such as effective permittivity and permeability @xcite . on the other hand , \n if the period to wavelength ratio is not very small or metal inclusions are involved , metamaterial response has an additional nonlocal contribution ( spatial dispersion ) and accordingly , nonlocal effective medium theories are in order . \n it is worth stressing that artificial electromagnetic chirality and optical magnetism , fundamental ingredients of metamaterial science , are manifestations of first and second order spatial dispersion , respectively @xcite . \n artificial electromagnetic chirality ( due to 3d , 2d and 1d geometrical chirality @xcite ) yields interesting electromagnetic phenomena as , for example , giant optical activity , asymmetric transmission , negative refractive index @xcite and repulsive casimir force @xcite . \n in addition , artificial or optical magnetism supports negative refractive index and backward - waves propagation . \n it is worth noting that second order spatial dispersion is not fully equivalent to artificial magnetism and such discrepancy has not been exploited in applied science . even though second order and \n non - magnetic nonlocalities are generally considered detrimental for several applications @xcite , they have been shown to support intriguing effects as propagation of additional waves @xcite and topological transitions @xcite . in this context , exploiting such nonlocalities is one of the challenges of metamaterial science . \n spatial dispersion is ruled by the period to wavelength ratio @xmath1 so that , unlike conventional matter , metamaterials offer a natural way for enhancing nonlocality by tailoring the meta - atoms spatial distribution . \n there are also other strategies to modify the hierarchy of the spatial dispersion orders : ( i ) by optimizing the shape and size of inclusions @xcite , ( ii ) by exploiting plasmonic resonances @xcite , ( iii ) by resorting to extreme regimes where the permittivity and/or the permeability are close to zero @xcite and ( iv ) by embedding high - index dielectric inclusions ( whose permittivity is such that @xmath2 ) @xcite . \n the latter strategy has been crucially exploited to achieve all - dielectric metamaterials ( whose response has also a magnetic contribution ) without high dissipation @xcite .    in this paper \n we propose a strategy to achieve an unusual electromagnetic response where the first and second order nonlocalities contributions are both enhanced , without resorting to plasmonic resonances , to the point that the effect of their mutual competition is comparable with the local medium response . \n such competition is very unusual in non - resonating setups since the two nonlocalities have generally different orders of magnitude and , remarkably , since their symmetry properties are different , the first and second order spatial dispersions being ruled and unaffected by geometric chirality , respectively . \n we show that this occurs in multi - layered media : @xmath3 comprising inclusions whose dielectric permittivity is such that @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the small period to vacuum wavelength ratio , ( slightly high index inclusions ) ; @xmath4 whose average permittivity is much smaller than @xmath5 . \n we analyze by first principle the ensuing and unprecedented metamaterial response and we show that transverse magnetic ( tm ) waves are ruled by a biquadratic highly tunable energy - momentum relation supporting a plethora of phenomena encompassing additional waves and topological phase transitions . \n in addition to hyperbolic , elliptic and mixed regimes , the metamaterial supports a topologically nontrivial dispersion regime characterized by bounded and multiply - connected isofrequency contours accompanied by additional waves . \n the proposed slightly high index inclusions metamaterials ( shims ) , are structurally very simple and provide a novel route to exploit spatial dispersion for steering the radiation . \n a further significant advantage of shims over high index inclusion metamaterials is that the requirement @xmath0 is much less severe than the condition @xmath2 @xcite and hence shims can be manufactured in spectral regions where extremely high permittivity media are not available , as for example , the optical range .    consider a one - dimensional multilayered medium which is periodically stratified along the @xmath6-axis and whose unit cell , of thickness @xmath7 , consists of a background dielectric matrix hosting an inclusion ( see fig.[five - regimes](a ) ) . \n the dielectric permittivity @xmath8 is @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the matrix and the inclusion , respectively . in the presence of a monochromatic electromagnetic field ( @xmath11 ) \n whose vacuum wavelength @xmath12 is larger than the stratification period , the small ratio @xmath13 rules the homogenization of the medium response . \n as defined in the introduction , a shim is characterized by the two basic requirements :    1 . \n @xmath14 , @xmath0 ; 2 . \n @xmath15 ;    ( where overline labels the average on the unit cell ) . \n we have performed a multi - scale analysis of tm waves electrodynamics ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 , see supplemental material ) in shims and we have obtained that , in the long wavelength limit @xmath18 , the leading medium response is modeled by the constitutive relations @xmath19 where @xmath20^{-1 } , \\ : \\epsilon_{\\perp } = \\overline{\\varepsilon(x ) } +   \\sum_n \\frac{a_{-n } a_{n}}{n^2 } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\kappa & = & i \\epsilon _ { || } \\sum_n \\frac{a_{-n } b_{n}}{n } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\delta & = & \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{|| } } \\left ( \\sum_n   \\frac{a_{-n } a_{n}}{n^2 } -

fedorov transformation method \n @xcite it is straightforward proving that the obtained first order spatial dispersion is equivalent to 1d - electromagnetic chirality @xcite and that the second order spatial dispersion is non - magnetic ( i.e. there is not transformation yielding a non - vanishing magnetic permeability ) . \n it is essential here stressing that eqs.([response ] ) does not contain @xmath1 and this physically yields an unprecedented regime where local response and nonlocalities mutually compete on the same footing . note that in media with shallow dielectric modulation spatial dispersion contributions are too weak to appear in the leading order term of the effective response ( they are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ) @xcite . \n the shim requirements ( i ) and ( ii ) forbid resonances that would produce a dominant local response and at the same time they trigger a peculiar nonlocality enhancement which differently raises the standard first and second order spatial dispersions contributions , whereas higher order spatial dispersion contributions are still weak . in order to discuss this point , \n let us first analyze its local component . \n due to the shim requirement @xmath3 , the average of @xmath29 is dominated by the background contribution @xmath9 so that @xmath30 ( see the first of eqs.([par_eff ] ) ) . \n this is a key point characterizing shims since , in the presence of a uniformly large dielectric spatial modulation , @xmath31 is so large to yield superlensing @xcite which is unaffected by spatial dispersion . \n the shim requirement @xmath4 , achievable by suitably tailoring the inclusion dielectric profile ( see below ) , states that first contribution @xmath32 to @xmath33 in the second of eqs.([par_eff ] ) is not large . on the other hand , the fourier coefficients of @xmath8 ( with @xmath34 ) \n are @xmath23 with @xmath35 as a consequence of the shim requirement @xmath3 and hence @xmath36 . in other words , even if the dielectric modulation is large , a shim has effective permittivities which are not so large to suppress the effect of spatial dispersion . \n let us analyze now the nonlocal response . \n the shim requirement @xmath3 implies that all the fourier coefficients of @xmath37 are dominated by the permittivity of the background and hence @xmath38 . as a consequence , from the third and fourth of eqs.([par_eff ] ) , the whole shim nonlocal response is as strong as the local component . \n such a peculiar spatial dispersion enhancement can heuristically be grasped from the effective medium response of a layered medium with shallow ( s ) dielectric modulation reported in ref.@xcite . \n the constitutive relations of that case for tm waves coincide with eqs.([response ] ) without the second order spatial dispersion contribution and with electromagnetic parameters @xmath39^{-1}$ ] , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the fourier coefficients of @xmath8 and @xmath44 . \n spatial dispersion in this situation is weak since @xmath45 and this is due to the low dielectric contrast . \n the crucial point here is that if we replace @xmath46 and @xmath47 in @xmath48 the expression of @xmath49 of eqs.([par_eff ] ) is fully recovered so that we can state that shim mechanism is literally able to haul first order spatial dispersion from the @xmath1 order to the leading one . \n generalizing , this observation also sheds light on the shim enhancement of the second order spatial dispersion which , in a low dielectric contrast medium , is very weak ( @xmath28 ) with contributions containing either two @xmath42 or two @xmath43 terms . \n the above shim mechanism of raising only @xmath50 ( for @xmath34 ) thus efficiently boosts the contributions containing two @xmath42 terms and this explains their appearance in eqs.([par_eff ] ) . \n we conclude that the specific shim structure ( see requirements ( i ) and ( ii ) ) crucially modifies the spatial dispersion orders hierarchy to the point of triggering an unprecedented overall competition between first and second order contribution which are as strong as the local optical response .     and @xmath10 are the matrix and the inclusion permettivities , respectively . \n ( b)-(f ) isofrequency contours corresponding to the topologically different dispersion regimes supported by a shim.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to discuss the physical consequences of the strong shim nonlocal response , we analyze here the energy - momentum relation of tm waves @xmath51 , propagating in a lossless structure , which is @xmath52 \n the first remarkable consequence of second order spatial dispersion ( represented by @xmath53 ) is that such equation is biquadratic . \n the above discussed competition between local response and nonlocalities implies that , in principle , every possible regime provided by eq.([disp2 ] ) can be achieved since the four coefficients in eqs.([disp2 ] ) depend on the four independent effective shim parameters which , in turn , are mutually comparable .    ) in the elliptic -

regimes ] we have sketched ( a ) the geometry of the stratified shim together with all the possible and topologically different isofrequency contours supported by eq.([disp2 ] ) whose associated five different regimes are : ( b ) hyperbolic - like i , ( c ) hyperbolic - like ii , ( d ) mixed , ( e ) elliptic - like i and ( f ) elliptic - like ii . it is remarkable that the class of shim metamaterials is able to support such a variety of regimes comprising both bounded ( e and f ) and unbounded ( b , c and d ) propagating wave spectra whose isofrequency contours \n can both be connected ( e ) and disconnected ( b , c , d and f ) . the mixed regime of fig.[five - regimes](d ) \n is characterized by an isofrequency contour showing elliptic - like and hyperbolic - like components @xcite . \n the elliptic - like ii regime of fig.[five - regimes](f ) has never been predicted , to the best of our knowledge , in one - dimensional metamaterials and it is main remarkable feature is that , within the allowed @xmath56 spectral region , there are two forward tm propagating waves with the same transverse momentum , i.e. additional waves occur .    in order to check the accuracy of the shim effective response of eqs.([response ] ) we compare its predictions with the full electromagnetic theory , both analytical ( bloch analysis of 1d photonic crystals ) and numerical ( 2d full - wave simulation @xcite ) . as a benchmark example to discuss the shim feasibility , \n we consider a periodically stratified structure whose unit cell comprises three homogeneous slabs , two of which ( @xmath57,@xmath58 ) represent the inclusion and the third ( @xmath59 ) describes the background . \n we consider a situation where the period to wavelength ratio is @xmath60 and we choose @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 with filling fractions @xmath64 and @xmath65 . \n such a material design meets the shim requirements since @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . \n the situation belongs to the elliptic - like ii regime of fig.[five - regimes](f ) where additional waves are expected as sketched in fig.[comparison](a ) . for this particular shim , we have numerically evaluated @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 from eqs.([par_eff ] ) . in fig.[comparison](b ) , we compare the isofrequency contour from eqs.([disp2 ] ) with the standard transfer matrix approach which provides the quasi - momentum @xmath73 of the bloch modes . \n the agreement of the above discussed shim response with full electromagnetic theory is particularly evident together with the occurrence of additional waves . \n note also that @xmath74 and @xmath75^{-1 } = -1 $ ] so that the standard effective medium theory predicts that plane waves propagation is forbidden in the considered medium , in striking contrast with the common result of our shim theory and of full electromagnetic analysis . \n it is worth stressing that such spatial dispersion dominated regime is achieved by means of relatively small values of the layers permittivities as compared to those pertaining high index inclusion metamaterials @xcite . due to the relevance and the novelty of such regime \n , we have analyzed through full wave simulations the excitation of the additional waves inside a slab of thickness @xmath76 @xmath77 m and filled by the above considered shim with period @xmath78 @xmath77 m . the slab is illuminated by a monochromatic plane wave with wavelength @xmath79 @xmath77 m and normally impinging onto the facet @xmath80 , as sketched in fig.[comparison](a ) . in fig.[comparison](c ) , we plot @xmath81 along the slab thickness and its profile reveals the occurrence of different spatial harmonics . in fig.[comparison](d ) we report the modulus of the fourier spectrum of @xmath81 which displays four distinct peaks corresponding to two forward and two backward propagating waves thus proving the possibility to excite additional waves in finite - thick slab . for completeness , in fig.[comparison](b ) we have superimposed to the above isofrequency contours the four waves numbers @xmath82 ( circles ) which coincide with those predicted by the above description of an unbounded shim .     to @xmath83 . \n shim dispersion at the vacuum wavelength @xmath84 shows a wave - vector degeneracy at @xmath85 and an associated dirac point . \n , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the existence of various different dispersion regimes implies that shims also host unusual topological transitions . as an example we consider a three - layer structure whose \n layers are filled with silver ag ( 1 playing the role of the inclusion ) , silicon oxide sio@xmath86 ( 2 ) and air ( 3 ) , with filling fractions @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . \n we have modelled the ag dielectric response with the drude permittivity @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 , @xmath92 s@xmath93 , \n @xmath94 s@xmath93 @xcite ) , and we have assumed for the sio@xmath86 permittivity @xmath95 an empirical sellmeier equation @xcite . \n we have evaluated the isofrequency contours for various vacuum wavelength both using the above shim response and the bloch theory and compared them with the isofrequency contours obtained from the standard homogenization theory of layered media @xcite . in fig.[transitions ] we plot @xmath96 and @xmath97 as functions of @xmath56 ( real ) at the three wavelengths @xmath98 . \n the agreement between shim and bloch theory is remarkable at any wavelength whereas the standard theory is not adequate since it reproduces a portion around @xmath54 of a single connected component of the correct isofrequency contours . at @xmath99 \n the shim is in the hyperbolic - like i regime since the lower and upper branches of figs.[transitions](a ) and ( b ) are of pure dissipative origin . on the other hand at @xmath83 ( figs.[transitions](e ) and ( f ) ) , \n the shim is in the mixed regime and this proves that a topological transition between the two regimes . \n it is remarkable that the such transition is accompanied by an intermediate state at @xmath84 ( see figs.[transitions](c ) and ( d ) ) where the two dispersion branches of the mixed regime merge at @xmath54 thus producing a wave - vector degeneracy and an associated dirac point .    in conclusion \n , we have introduced a class of 1d metamaterials ( shims ) supporting a peculiar electrodynamic behavior driven by optical nonlocalities . in comparison with other spatial dispersion enhancement strategies , since the inclusion permittivity is slightly high ( as defined above ) , our method for tailoring the shim response is not severely hampered by the lack of materials with very high dielectric permittivity . \n the shim structure triggers a novel physical mechanism boosting at the same time both electromagnetic chirality and second order nonlocality to the point of achieving their competition , in striking contrast to essentially all the other situation hitherto investigated . \n the dominant role played by spatial dispersion in shim leads to a variety of different electromagnetic regimes supporting exotic phenomena such as topological phase transitions an transverse magnetic additional waves . due to the their feasibility and to the variety of topologically different regimes \n they host , we believe that shims and their extension to higher dimensional structures could play a pivotal role for conceiving a novel class of metamaterials and radiation steering devices where optical nonlocality is fully exploited even in the optical range .",

    "this article begins with a brief introduction to numerical relativity aimed at readers who have a background in applied mathematics but not necessarily in general relativity . \n i then introduce and summarise my work on the problem of treating asymptotically flat spacetimes of infinite extent with finite computational resources . \n two different approaches are considered . \n the first approach is the standard one and is based on evolution on cauchy hypersurfaces with artificial timelike boundary . \n the well posedness of a set of constraint - preserving boundary conditions for the einstein equations in generalised harmonic gauge is analysed , their numerical performance is compared with various alternate methods , and improved absorbing boundary conditions are constructed and implemented . in the second approach , one solves the einstein equations on hyperboloidal ( asymptotically characteristic ) hypersurfaces . \n these are conformally compactified towards future null infinity , where gravitational radiation is defined in an unambiguous way . \n we show how the formally singular terms arising in a @xmath0 reduction of the equations can be evaluated at future null infinity , present stable numerical evolutions of vacuum axisymmetric black hole spacetimes and study late - time power - law tails of matter fields in spherical symmetry .    _ \n submitted as the introductory chapter of a habilitation thesis consisting of the published papers @xcite@xcite to the department of mathematics and computer science at freie universitt berlin in november 2013 _ \n this article is organised as follows . in section [ s : nr ] \n we give an introduction to the basics of numerical relativity , with a focus on the cauchy problem , formulations of einstein s equations and numerical methods . in section \n [ s : outer ] we introduce the main subject of this thesis , the treatment of asymptotically flat spacetimes and the `` outer boundary problem '' in numerical relativity . \n section [ s : ibvp ] summarises my work on the first approach to this problem , namely cauchy evolution with artificial timelike boundary . \n section [ s : scri ] is devoted to a different approach based on hyperboloidal evolution to future null infinity . finally in section [ s : concl ] \n we conclude and give a brief outlook on future research directions .",

    "transport phenomena on a quantum scale appear in a variety of systems , ranging from photosynthetic complexes to engineered quantum devices . \n it has been predicted that the efficiency of quantum transport can be enhanced through dynamic interaction between the system and a noisy environment . \n we report the first experimental demonstration of such environment - assisted quantum transport , using an engineered network of laser - written waveguides , with relative energies and inter - waveguide couplings tailored to yield the desired hamiltonian . \n controllable decoherence is simulated via broadening the bandwidth of the input illumination , yielding a significant increase in transport efficiency relative to the narrowband case . \n we show integrated optics to be suitable for simulating specific target hamiltonians as well as open quantum systems with controllable loss and decoherence . \n recent research into photosynthetic antenna complexes has shown evidence of coherence in excitonic energy transport  @xcite , despite the noisy cellular environment in which such complexes are found . \n indeed , environmental decoherence has been credited with increasing the efficiency of transport through these systems , an effect known as environment - assisted quantum transport ( enaqt )  @xcite or dephasing - assisted transport  @xcite . while enaqt has been the subject of many theoretical studies  whether in the photosynthetic context  @xcite or in other nanoscale transport systems  @xcite  and despite its potential for improving transport in artificial quantum systems , it has so far never been directly observed . \n we use an integrated photonic simulator to demonstrate the first implementation of enaqt . \n our simulator was fabricated using femtosecond - laser direct writing , which allows waveguides to be drawn directly into glass using a focused pulsed laser . \n this permits the creation of three - dimensional waveguide arrays , as well as precision and repeatability in engineering interactions  @xcite . \n we used control over the wavelength and bandwidth of the guided light to simulate effective decoherence , thereby enhancing transport efficiency . \n we consider a single excitation on a network of @xmath0 coupled sites , governed by a tight - binding hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the excitation being localised at site @xmath3 , @xmath4 the energy of that site , and @xmath5 the coupling between sites @xmath3 and @xmath6 . \n although enaqt can occur on an ordered lattice where all the energies @xmath4 are equal  @xcite , transport enhancement was first explained in disordered systems , which we consider here . \n we are interested in the efficiency of transport from a particular initial site to a particular target site , where the excitation is trapped . in the case of a photosynthetic complex ( figure  [ fig : enaqt]a ) \n , trapping describes the transfer of excitons to a reaction center , where they drive charge separation . \n it can be modelled as irreversible coupling of the target site to a sink at rate @xmath7 ( figure  [ fig : enaqt]b ) . \n the efficiency is then the probability of finding the exciton in the sink after some particular time . \n enaqt occurs when decoherence increases the trapping probability over the fully coherent case . \n decoherence results from coupling of a quantum system to inaccessible degrees of freedom . \n for example , in photosynthetic antenna complexes , the energies of chromophores are coupled to molecular vibrations ; tracing out this environment results in decoherence in the excitonic subspace .    in the absence of decoherence \n , energetic disorder tends to localise the wavepacket through processes such as destructive interference or anderson localisation  @xcite , thus preventing it from reaching the target . \n since these are coherent processes , they are diminished by decoherence , possibly resulting in enhancement of transport efficiency to the target site . \n an alternative but ultimately equivalent view of enaqt is that eigenstates of @xmath8 are stationary , making it difficult to reach the target if the initial and target sites differ in energy . \n incoherent processes , however , permit transitions between the eigenstates of @xmath8 , yielding greater mobility .    the first theoretical explorations of enaqt focused on the case where the decoherence takes the form of site - independent , markovian , pure dephasing  @xcite . \n although the decoherence in our simulation is neither site - based nor markovian , this is not an obstacle to enaqt ;  @xcite transport efficiency can be enhanced as long as the decoherence allows population transfer between otherwise - stationary eigenstates . \n we simulate enaqt in an array of coupled single - mode optical waveguides obeying the equation  @xcite @xmath9 where the light is propagating in the @xmath10-direction , @xmath11 is a creation operator for a photon in waveguide @xmath3 at position @xmath10 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively the propagation constants of the waveguides and the couplings between them . \n the former are determined by the waveguides refractive index profiles , while the latter also depend on the separations between them . \n light propagation governed by this schrdinger - like equation directly simulates evolution under @xmath8 , with @xmath13 replacing @xmath5 and the @xmath12 replacing @xmath4 . \n we can thus simulate different hamiltonians by controlling the number , position , and refractive indices of the waveguides . \n the intrinsic stability of laser - written waveguide arrays renders decoherence challenging to simulate . \n one approach is to stochastically modulate the index of refraction along each waveguide  @xcite . \n though every realization with a particular longitudinal index profile will be fully coherent , decoherence can be simulated by averaging over the recorded optical outputs from many realizations in post - processing . \n this approach was recently used to simulate decoherence - enhanced navigation of a maze  @xcite .    by contrast , we simulate decoherence by averaging over the results from a single array illuminated with many optical wavelengths . \n although each individual wavelength propagates through the waveguide array coherently , decoherence can be achieved using broadband illumination and a single output intensity measurement which does not resolve wavelength . in other words , the wavelength degree of freedom \n is traced out yielding a partially mixed state . \n similar approaches are well established in optics , where for instance thick birefringent quartz plates followed by wavelength - insensitive measurements have been used to decohere the polarization states of single photons  @xcite .        as an example of our approach to simulating decoherence \n , we consider two uncoupled waveguides @xmath14 and @xmath15 that have a difference @xmath16 in their propagation constants at a wavelength @xmath17 . as light propagates along the waveguides \n , it will accumulate a phase difference @xmath18 between them . \n broadband illumination can then be seen to cause effective decoherence on a length scale comparable to the illumination coherence length : any initial coherence @xmath19 between the waveguides will decay : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the normalised first - order temporal correlation function of the light , which  being proportional to the fourier transform of the spectrum \n decays to zero faster for spectrally broader illumination . \n the strength @xmath22 of the decoherence can be quantified as the inverse of the optical coherence length , @xmath23 , and is usually proportional to the fwhm bandwidth @xmath24 . for a uniform distribution centered at @xmath17 , @xmath25    in the case of coupled waveguides \n , wavelength dependence affects couplings in addition to the propagation constants . \n the resulting decoherence will therefore not only have characteristics of pure dephasing ( as in equation  ) , but will also include off - diagonal terms . \n however , this kind of decoherence can also result in enaqt . \n indeed , the off - diagonal terms imply that our decoherence could , in principle , be used to simulate enaqt in ordered systems  @xcite , but the effect would be weaker because of the absence of the pure - dephasing contribution .    for our simulation we chose a network of four waveguide sites  arranged as in figure  [ fig : enaqt]c  because it is one of the smallest systems in which enaqt is possible and because it can give significant enhancements even with relatively weak decoherence . \n waveguide 1 was the input , waveguide 3 the target , and the sink consisted of a long linear array of tightly coupled waveguides . \n the coupling between waveguides in this sink was significantly higher than between the four main waveguides , so that any light entering the sink from waveguide 3 was largely transported away  @xcite . \n the sink need only be long enough to prevent light reflected from the far end from returning into the main simulation waveguides . \n we need to choose propagation constants and separations among the four main waveguides in order to best approximate this hamiltonian : @xmath26 where all parameters depend on the wavelength @xmath27 of the input light . due to their wide separations , \n couplings between non - neighbouring sites are negligible ( @xmath28 of neighbouring - site couplings ) . \n our simulator is designed so that , at our central simulation wavelength @xmath17 , @xmath29 in this case , one of the eigenstates of @xmath8 has no support on site 3 , @xmath30 , while the remaining three eigenstates all have substantial support on site 3 . \n because @xmath31 can not couple to the sink  at least at @xmath17the maximum trapping efficiency at infinite time is @xmath32 .    considering the wavelength dependence of @xmath8 \n provides a different way to see the decohering effects of broadband illumination . due to \n the dependence of @xmath33 and @xmath34 on the wavelength , equation   only holds at a particular wavelength @xmath17 . at other wavelengths \n , @xmath31 will have some support on waveguide 3 and thus be able to couple to the sink , increasing the efficiency above @xmath35 , as shown in figure  [ fig : enaqt]d . \n unlike in other examples of enaqt  @xcite , the efficiency increases monotonically with the strength of decoherence , meaning there is no optimal level of decoherence in this model .    based on measurements of couplings and propagation constants in isolated pairs of waveguides ( see methods ) \n , we selected the following design parameters : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ( see figure  [ fig : enaqt]c ) . figure  [ fig : setup]a shows numerical modelling of light propagation given these parameters . although these were designed for a center wavelength of 800  nm , variations in the implementation of the waveguide parameters resulted in equation  [ eqn : condition ] being satisfied at @xmath39  nm .    we measured the efficiency using narrowband light ( less than 1  nm bandwidth and always horizontally polarised for consistency ) from a tuneable ti : sapphire laser ( spectra - physics tsunami ) in quasi - cw mode ( figure  [ fig : setup]b ) . \n the output was imaged using a custom - built @xmath40 magnifying telescope and the optical power was measured using a large - area power - meter after isolating either the system or sink waveguides using a variable slit . \n examples of the output distribution are given in figure  [ fig : setup]c , showing the significant difference between illumination at @xmath17 and an off - center wavelength . \n figure  [ fig : results]a shows the measured efficiency ( fraction of light output in the sink modes ) for wavelengths ranging from 745 to 835  nm . \n enaqt  shown in figure  [ fig : results]b  is the average enhancement in efficiency over the spectral band of interest , relative to the efficiency at @xmath17 , @xmath41 where the average @xmath42 over @xmath27 is taken over the top - hat distribution on @xmath43 . as predicted \n , it is an increasing function of the bandwidth , i.e. , of the decoherence strength @xmath22 . \n the highest enaqt observed was @xmath44 at a bandwidth of @xmath45  nm . \n we thus demonstrated that coherent transport in a coupled , statically disordered system can be enhanced through decoherence .    the theoretical prediction in figure  [ fig : results]b contains no free parameters . it is a simulation of the dynamics under the simulated hamiltonian @xmath8 , together with trapping from site 3 at the rate @xmath7 discussed in methods and pure dephasing between waveguide @xmath46 and the other three waveguides at rate @xmath22 . \n the disagreement between theory and experiment is small considering the number of possible contributing factors . \n these include the off - diagonal decoherence when the waveguides are coupled , the fact that the trapping is not perfectly exponential , errors in the measurements of the coupling constants , optical losses , and error in satisfying equation  [ eqn : condition ] . as an example , the shaded band in figure  [ fig : results]b represents the error that would arise if @xmath47 deviated from @xmath48 by up to 10% .    in our experiment , \n the magnitude of enaqt was limited by the maximum achievable decoherence , which at @xmath49  @xmath50 was small compared to the inverse of the propagation length . \n we were limited by two components of equation : the tunability of our laser limited @xmath24 , while @xmath51 was limited ( via equation ) by the need to keep @xmath34 small enough to stay in the tight - binding approximation . \n these are not fundamental limitations , and future improvements that increase @xmath22 would result in significantly larger transport enhancement ; as shown in figure  [ fig : enaqt]d , the transport efficiency of this model can get arbitrarily close to 1 for sufficiently long propagation distances and decoherence strengths . \n stronger decoherence would also allow enaqt to be observed in networks that are less sensitive to decoherence than our model . \n our results demonstrate that integrated photonics are well - suited for simulating open quantum systems , capable of implementing a disordered target hamiltonian with controllable loss . \n the technique of using broadband excitation to introduce tuneable levels of decoherence ensures that photonics can simulate open quantum systems ; previously , low intrinsic noise in photonic devices rendered decoherence difficult to realize in integrated optics , particularly without averaging over results from many different device realizations . \n our approach will not only improve the controllability of photonic quantum simulation , but also aid in the experimental optimisation of transport in other engineered quantum systems .",

    "topological landscape is introduced for networks with functions defined on the nodes . by extending the notion of gradient flows to the network setting , critical nodes of different indices are defined . \n this leads to a concise and hierarchical representation of the network . \n persistent homology from computational topology is used to design efficient algorithms for performing such analysis . \n applications to some examples in social and biological networks are demonstrated , which show that critical nodes carry important information about structures and dynamics of such networks . \n networks have become ubiquitous tools for describing structures that occur in a variety of fields in the past ten or fifteen years , including biology , social sciences , economics and engineering . to study a network \n , one has to endow it with some mathematical structure . \n the simplest mathematical structure on a network is the graph structure . \n this gives rise to notions such as degrees , paths , connectivity , etc . \n the distinctions between scale - free networks and small - world networks , for example , can be studied by examining this structure , see for example @xcite . \n but one can endow a network with more sophisticated structures , such as geometric structure as in the theory of manifold learning , @xcite , or topological structure as in the theory of persistent homology @xcite . \n these structures allow us to probe more deeply into the nature of the network .    in this paper \n , we discuss how one can endow a network with a _ \n landscape _ when we study a function on the node set . \n the concept of landscape has been crucial in physics and chemistry in describing complex systems , such as energy landscape @xcite . \n the introduction of such a concept into complex networks may equip us with a concise description of global structures of networks and help explain certain dynamics such as information diffusion and transition pathways . \n many complex networks in real world carry flows of information , products , power , etc . \n , which are driven by local gradients of a scalar or energy @xcite . \n for example traffic flows may be driven by congestion function , heat flows are driven by temperature . in biomolecular folding , \n conformational changes are driven by the free energy of states . on internet , \n user s attention may be driven by the centrality or significance of websites such as pagerank . in these cases , communities or groups \n emerge as metastable sets of gradient - based dynamics or energy basins . \n therefore understanding the landscape of such functions will be crucial to disclose associated dynamics in complex networks . in the core of the landscape \n lies the notion of critical nodes . in continuous \n setting this meets the classical morse theory in the study of manifolds @xcite , where critical points can be located by vanishing gradients and their indices can be decided by dimensionality of the unstable manifold passing through . \n however such an approach can not be applied to the graph settings as there is no unambiguous definition of dimensionality in general . \n precisely , consider an undirected graph @xmath0 with a function defined on the node set @xmath1 . \n the question we will attempt to address is : _ given a function on its nodes , how can we endow the network with a landscape , so that one can distinguish critical nodes such as the local minima , local maxima , and saddles _ ? \n there are several studies in the literature which may lead to critical nodes for graphs by carrying morse theory to discrete settings . \n nevertheless , none of them gives a satisfied answer to the question . in computational geometry \n one may embed the graph into a 2d - surface and then apply morse theory for 2-manifolds @xcite . \n however , such a surface embedding is not natural for general graphs in biological and social networks . \n another candidate is discrete morse theory @xcite , which studies functions defined on all faces of cell complexes and is therefore hard to use in the graph setting above . \n a related subject is the extension of the poincare - hopf theorem to the graph setting , e.g. in @xcite . in this paper \n we present a purely combinatorial approach which starts from a discrete gradient flow induced by the function on graph nodes . \n such an approach does not need a surface embedding , and turns out to be closely related to persistent homology in computational topology @xcite and discrete morse theory @xcite without studying functions on high dimensional cells . \n in particular , given a function ( often referred to as an energy function ) on a network , we will define a discrete gradient flow associated with that function , as well as minimum energy paths between two disjoint sets of nodes . \n this allows us to define critical nodes or saddles . roughly speaking , critical nodes \n are associated with minimum energy paths between node pairs : index-@xmath2 critical nodes are simply local minima ; index-@xmath3 critical nodes are the highest energy transition nodes of minimal energy paths connecting index-@xmath4 critical nodes . \n such a critical node analysis , as we show by examples in social networks and biological networks , leads to a concise representation of networks while preserving some important structural properties . in short \n , the local minima or maxima together with their attraction basins can be interpreted as communities or groups in networks ; saddle points act as transition states between different critical points of lower indices . in particular , in social networks index-1 saddles act as hubs in connecting communities ; in biomolecular dynamics , index-1 saddles play roles as intermediate or transition states connecting misfolded and native states . in the latter , \n such an analysis does not rely on commonly used markov state model , whence can be applied to much more general data analysis . \n moreover , this approach leads to a hierarchical classification of nodes in the network and a global visualization of networks adaptive to the landscape of given energy function .    in algorithmic aspect , critical nodes in this paper \n can be computed at a polynomial time cost with an algorithm based on computational topology by monitoring topological changes over energy evel sets , and in nondegenerate case an almost linear algorithm exists which is scalable for the analysis of large scale networks .",

splitting @xmath88 of the electron ) @xcite . \n @xmath89 $ ] under the control of a sequence of @xmath68-rotations on electron spin at @xmath90 and @xmath91 . \n the coherence factor @xmath92 is insensitive , up to a factor of @xmath93 , to the selection of initial bath state @xmath94 ( verified by numerical evaluations ) , and is taken out of the summation @xcite . \n both the inhomogeneous broadening and the pure decoherence due to the extrinsic bath spin interaction are shown to be removed at the classic spin echo time @xmath95 in contrast to the unusual recovery time of @xmath96 in the case of intrinsic bath spin interaction . \n we need a pulse sequence to produce a time where the decoherence from all three sources can be removed . \n a solution is a two - pulse control . \n fig . \n [ fig2](a ) shows that , after a second electron spin flip at @xmath97 , the paths of the two pseudospin states corresponding to the electron @xmath18 states driven by the intrinsic nuclear spin pair interaction cross again at @xmath98 , coinciding with the secondary spin echo time for the other two causes . \n this two pulse sequence is well - known as carr - purcell sequence in nmr spectroscopies @xcite . \n the residual decoherence at @xmath99 is @xmath100 . \n the restoration by two - pulse control of coherence in the presence of both pure and ensemble decoherence is demonstrated by the results of numerical evaluation shown in fig . \n [ fig2](b , c ) . \n the electron spin coherence is restored at @xmath101 by the second pulse even when the first spin - echo at @xmath95 has completely vanished , illustrating the remarkable observation @xcite that the absence of spin echo does not mean irreversible loss of coherence . \n the power of concatenation of pulse sequences has been shown in the context of dynamical decoupling in quantum computation @xcite . \n similarly , the control of disentanglement of the bath states from the quantum object may be enhanced by concatenation . the pseudo - spin evolution with the two - pulse control of the quantum object \n can be constructed recursively from the free - induction evolution @xmath102 , by the concatenation , @xmath103 , @xmath104 . \n the process can be extended by iteration , fig . \n [ fig2](d ) , to any level , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the rotation vector along the axis of rotation through an angle @xmath107 . \n disentanglement occurs at @xmath108 coinciding with the classic spin echo . for small @xmath107 , \n the recursion relation is @xmath109 . at each iteration , \n the rotation vectors of the conjugate pseudo - spin states have their mean @xmath110 increased by a factor of @xmath111 and their difference @xmath112 reduced by a factor of @xmath113 ( deduced by induction from @xmath114 ) . \n the decoherence is reduced by an order of @xmath115 at @xmath116 for each additional level of concatenation till saturation at the level @xmath117 . \n hence , the coherence echo magnitude scales with the echo delay time according to @xmath118 as shown in fig . \n [ fig2](e ) . \n our result shows the protection of electron spin coherence by pulse sequences with interpulse interval up to @xmath119s    in conclusion , we note that our scheme of restoring the coherence depends on the pure decoherence being driven by the interaction in the spin bath and by the domination of the bath pair excitation in the slow bath dynamics . \n the pulse sequence design is borrowed from the dynamical decoupling schemes in nmr spectroscopies @xcite and in quantum computation @xcite but the disentanglement method aims directly at the bath dynamics . \n our method seeks not to eliminate the object - bath interaction by dynamical averaging , but to disentangle by controlling the quantum object to maneuver the bath evolution . \n thus , elimination of coupling between the quantum object and the bath is not a necessary condition for their disentanglement , as illustrated by coherence recovery at @xmath120 where effective object - bath interaction does not vanish even in the first order of hyperfine coupling @xmath121 . \n direct observation of coherence echoes at such magic times is possible with the narrowing of inhomogeneous distribution by measurement projection @xcite . \n the control of bath spins may well develop into a valuable addition to the collection of armaments of coherence preservation for quantum information processing . \n we acknowledge support from nsf dmr-0403465 , aro / lps , and darpa / afosr .    26    natexlab#1#1bibnamefont # 1#1bibfnamefont # 1#1citenamefont # 1#1url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2]#2 [ 2][]#2    , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , _ _ ( , , ) , ed .    , * * , ( ) .    , \n * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) \n ; , * * , ( ) ; , , , * * , ( ) .    , _ _ ( , , ) .    , , , * * , ( ) .    , _ _ ( , , ) , ed .    , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , ( ) .    , , , , , \n * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , * * , ( ) . \n the orbital wavefunction of the electron covers all @xmath0 nuclei , so the contact hyperfine coupling with each nuclear spin is @xmath121 , inverse proportional to the bath size @xmath0 .    , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , , , , \n * * , ( ) .    , , , * * , ( ) . \n , , , , , ( ) ; , , , * * , ( ) ; , , , , * * , ( ) . \n * supplementary information for `` restoring coherence lost to a slow interacting mesoscopic bath '' *",

    "we analyze the performance of low - density - parity - check codes in the error - floor domain where the signal - to - noise - ratio , @xmath0 , is large , @xmath1 . \n we describe how the instanton method of theoretical physics , recently adapted to coding theory , solves the problem of characterizing the error - floor domain in the laplacian channel . \n an example of the @xmath2 ldpc code with four iterations ( each iteration consisting of two semi - steps : from bits - to - checks and from checks - to - bits ) of the min - sum decoding is discussed . a generalized computational tree analysis is devised to explain the rational structure of the leading instantons . \n the asymptotic for the symbol bit - error - rate in the error - floor domain is comprised of individual instanton contributions , each estimated as @xmath3 , where the effective distances , @xmath4 , of the the leading instantons are @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively . \n ( the hamming distance of the code is @xmath7 . ) \n the analysis shows that the instantons are distinctly different from the ones found for the same coding / decoding scheme performing over the gaussian channel . \n we validate instanton results against direct simulations and offer an explanation for remarkable performance of the instanton approximation not only in the extremal , @xmath8 , limit but also at the moderate @xmath0 values of practical interest . \n a novel exciting era has begun in coding theory with the discovery of low - density - parity - check ( ldpc ) @xcite and turbo @xcite codes . \n these codes are special , not only because they can approach the virtually error - free transmission limit , but mainly because a computationally efficient iterative decoding scheme is readily available . when operating at moderate noise values these approximate decoding algorithms show an unprecedented ability to correct errors , a remarkable feature that has attracted a lot of attention @xcite . \n however , it was also shown that the approximate algorithms are incapable of matching the performance of maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding beyond the so - called error - floor threshold found at higher signal - to - noise - ratios ( snr ) . \n the importance of error - floor , i.e. highest snr , analysis was recognized in the early stages of the turbo code revolution @xcite , and it soon became apparent that ldpc codes are also not immune to the error - floor deficiency @xcite . to estimate the error - floor asymptotics in modern high - quality systems is a notoriously difficult task because direct numerical methods , e.g.  monte carlo , can not be used to determine bit - error - rate ( ber ) below @xmath9 . \n the main approaches to the error - floor analysis problem proposed to date include : ( i ) a heuristic approach of the importance sampling type @xcite , utilizing theoretical considerations developed for a typical randomly constructed ldpc code performing over the binary - erasure channel @xcite , and ( ii ) deriving lower bounds for ber @xcite .    recently \n , we ( in collaboration with v.  chernyak and b.  vasic ) have also proposed a physics inspired approach that is capable of a computationally tractable analysis of the error floor phenomenon @xcite . \n an efficient numerical scheme was proposed , which was ab - initio by construction , i.e.  the optimization scheme required no additional assumptions ( e.g.  no sampling ) . \n this numerical optimization scheme , called the instanton - amoeba scheme , which plays a central role in our analysis , was shown to be accurate at producing configurations whose validity , for actual optimal noise configurations , can be verified theoretically . finally , the instanton - amoeba scheme , introduced in @xcite , is also generic , in that there are no restrictions related to the type of decoding or the channel .    to illustrate the last , most important point , we complement the analysis of @xcite that focused on the white gaussian symmetric channel , by using the new results for the white laplacian channel explained in this manuscript . \n our choice of the laplacian channel is arbitrary , e.g. influenced by its relevance to the description of fiber - optics communication channels . \n ( amplifier noise , known to have gaussian statistics , contributes additively to the electric signal carrying the information . \n however , the intensity , the electric field squared , is detected on the receiver end . \n therefore , the resulting transition probability , characterizing the noise in the fiber optics channel as the whole , shows exponential tails . \n see @xcite for a discussion of these and other statistical errors in fiber optics channels . ) \n our goal is to demonstrate using the example of the laplacian channel that    * the numerical optimization approach to finding the most damaging configuration of the noise , instanton - amoeba , is computationally efficient . * \n subsequent theoretical analysis of the iterative decoding instanton based on the notion of the computational tree is channel specific , but it is also generalizable , i.e. the theoretical scheme can be modified to explain the rational structure of instantons for any , in particular laplacian , channel . * \n instanton configurations for different channels are different . \n thus , information on the error - floor analysis available for a channel ( say , for the gaussian channel ) does not allow quantitative description of the error - floor in another channel ( say , in the laplacian channel ) . \n this manuscript is organized as follows . \n we describe the problem of error - floor analysis , introduce the laplacian channel and briefly review the results of @xcite in section  [ sec : intro ] . our theoretical analysis , generalizing the computational tree approach of @xcite , is detailed in section  [ sec : theo ] . \n section  [ sec : amoeba ] explains results of numerical instanton - amoeba evaluation . \n here we present the three most important ( for @xmath1 ) instantons , for example of the min - sum decoding with four iterations performing over the @xmath2 ldpc code described in @xcite . \n we also discuss here how the numerically found instanton is rationalized / explained theoretically . \n the comparison of monte carlo simulations and instanton prediction is discussed in section  [ sec : moderate ] . \n some final remarks and comments are presented in section  [ sec : concl ] concluding the manuscript .",

    "the dynamical mechanism at the origin of the non - local rheology of dense granular flows is investigated trough discrete element simulations . \n we show that the influence of a shear band on the mechanical behavior of a distant zone is contained in the spatial variations observed in the network of granular contacts . using a micro - rheology technique \n , we establish that the exponential responses hence obtained , do not proof the validity of a mechanical activation process as previously suggested , but stem from the spatial relaxation of the shear rate as a direct consequence of a macroscopic non - local constitutive relation . \n finally , by direct visualization of the local relaxation processes , we dismiss the kinetic elasto - plastic picture , where a flow is conceived as a quasi - static sequence of localized plastic events interacting through the stress field . \n we therefore conclude in favor of the jamming scenario , where geometrical constrains lead to coherent non - affine displacements along floppy modes , inherently non - local . \n soft amorphous materials are disordered assemblies of interacting particles that can resist shear like a solid , but which flow like a liquid under a sufficiently large applied shear stress , see @xcite and related references . \n the solid - like state is usually associated with highly multi - stable energy landscapes , whose origin allows one to classify these materials : entropy for colloidal suspensions @xcite , free energy for foams or emulsions ( surface tension ) as well as for soft elastomeric particles ( elasticity ) @xcite , and geometry for a granular material ( volume times imposed pressure ) @xcite . \n the rigidity transition is accordingly named colloidal glass transition , elasto - plastic depinning transition and jamming transition for these three classes of systems . like standard phase transitions , \n these dynamical transitions are associated with diverging length scales quantifying the degree of cooperativity in the flow or in the deformation response . amongst the consequences \n , experiments have shown that the rheology of granular materials and emulsions is non - local : the stress at a given location does not depend only on the local strain rate but also on the degree of mobility in the surrounding region @xcite . \n non - local constitutive relations were recently proposed and successfully tested against numerical and experimental results @xcite . \n as these relations are derived from a gradient expansion in the order parameter , analogous to a ginzburg -

locality . \n ( i ) for hard non - deformable grains , the topological analysis of the contact network provides a state parameter , the mean contact number @xmath8 , to distinguish between solid - like and liquid - like states . \n close to the jamming transition , flow is only possible along floppy modes , by essence spread in space and prescribing the cooperative motion of the particles @xcite . \n the evolution of the contact network results from the rapid formation of force chains followed by a slow zig - zag instability of these structures @xcite . \n ( ii ) for very elastic particles e.g. for foams , emulsions or glassy lennard jones phases , the dynamics in the quasi - static regime is controlled by elasto - plastic events  @xcite : when sheared , energy is slowly stored and rapidly released through scale - free avalanches , in close analogy with the depinning transition of an elastic line . \n recent experiments have suggested that an assembly of rigid particles could similarly present an intermittent succession of plastic events localized in space and time @xcite . \n ( iii ) the third picture is based on an analogy with eyring s transition state theory for the viscosity of liquids @xcite , where mechanical fluctuations would play the role of temperature in thermal systems . \n each plastic rearrangement is assumed to generate at random a new realization of the forces on the contact network , allowing for the formation of new weak zones where the next rearrangement will occur . in this letter \n , we will test successively these three pictures using discrete element simulations .    _ \n the numerical system _ is a 2d shear flow , similar to that used in  @xcite , and composed of grains confined between two rough solid walls . by means of gravity - like vertical forces \n , the normal stress @xmath9 is increased gradually in two thin boundary layers located close to the walls ( fig . \n [ fig1]a ) and reaches a constant value @xmath10 in the bulk ( fig . \n [ fig1]b ) . \n the yield parameter @xmath11 based on the shear stress @xmath0 , which is kept homogeneous across the cell , and on the dynamical friction coefficient @xmath12 is the central control parameter ( fig . \n [ fig1]b ) . in order to emphasize non - local effects , we focus here on the case @xmath13 , were the grains flow _ below the yield stress _ under the influence of the distant shear zone . \n _ _ the jamming framework  _ _ provides a picture of non - locality essentially based on the contact network geometry . \n the central criterion to render the status of a packing of hard grains is the mean contact number per grain @xmath8 . \n following maxwell rigidity criterion , we define the distance @xmath14 to isostaticity as the difference between the number of constrains and the number of degrees of freedom ( the number of force components ) . \n one must distinguish the case were a coulomb friction between the particles , of coefficient @xmath15 , is introduced from the frictionless case ( @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 were @xmath18 is the space dimension and @xmath19 the fraction of sliding contacts @xcite . \n a system is  solid  , i.e. rigid , when hyperstatic ( @xmath20 ) and  liquid  when hypostatic ( @xmath21 ) . \n importantly , this criterion is entirely non - local because it is global , which means that liquid or solid regions can hardly be isolated .    in our numerical system , \n @xmath8 and @xmath14 are defined as eulerian fields , by averaging over realizations or , equivalently , as we work with simulations in a statistically steady state , over time . in fig . \n [ fig1]c and fig .  [ fig1]d , we display profiles of @xmath14 , both in the frictional and frictionless cases . \n we first notice that all values are positive . \n these profiles can be fitted to a shape of the form @xmath22 . \n this means that @xmath14 spatially relaxes toward @xmath23 from both walls , in an exponential manner . \n the whole system ( the boundary layers and the bulk ) constitutes a single continuous liquid phase . from the jamming perspective , the flow in the bulk , observed when the stress is lower than the yield stress , results from a lack of coordination in the contact network . \n particles are expected to move cooperatively along floppy modes whose characteristic size diverges at the jamming point . \n a flowing region therefore favors the motion around it . \n as it affects the contact network geometry in its neighborhood , one expects the corresponding non - local correction to the rheology to remain finite in the limit of vanishing shear rate . \n since there is a relation between @xmath8 and the rescaled shear rate @xmath24  @xcite , this jamming picture is consistent with the non - local constitutive relation based on a gradient expansion in @xmath25 , derived , calibrated and tested in a previous letter @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the effective friction coefficient for homogeneous shear flows . \n the laplacian @xmath28 encodes the non - local effect , assumed isotropic ; it is rescaled by @xmath25 to form @xmath29 , which remains finite as @xmath30 . \n the linear expansion of the non - local correction is written as @xmath31 , with @xmath32 .    _ \n _ mechanical activation _ \n la eyring _  _ _ has recently been put forward in the interpretation of the experiments of reddy  _ et al _ @xcite . \n the conceptual idea of these authors was to measure the rheology within a shear band that is below the yield condition , but under the remote influence of a shear zone forced by rigid boundaries . as discussed below , \n an exponential behavior of the local shear rate with the distance to the yield condition has been interpreted as a boltzmann - like factor , with an effective ` temperature ' that would result from mechanical activation .    to investigate whether this behavior is consistent with the previous picture , we probe numerically the rheological response with a local micro - rheometer in the spirit of the set - up proposed by @xcite ( fig . \n [ fig2]a and @xcite ) . \n bulk horizontal forces acting on grains are added to impose a different shear stress in a small central region . \n fig . \n [ fig2]b shows the resulting profile of the yield parameter @xmath33 . as before , \n the flow is driven by the two boundary layers located close to the moving walls , which are above the yield condition . in the bulk \n , the flow is kept below the yield condition ( i.e. @xmath34 ) . \n the shear rate at the locations where @xmath33 crosses @xmath35 is noted @xmath36 and is considered as a boundary condition for the bulk rheology . \n the micro - rheometer is the central region where a different yield parameter @xmath37 is imposed . \n its thickness is noted @xmath38 and its location is @xmath39 away from the boundaries ( fig . \n [ fig2]a ) . \n the relation between the shear rate @xmath40 in the center of the micro - rheometer and the rescaled shear stress @xmath37 gives access to the local rheological properties . in practice , @xmath40 depends on four other parameters : @xmath36 , @xmath2 , @xmath39 and @xmath41 . in the experiments of @xcite , the micro - rheometer was a small rod immersed in a granular medium confined in a couette cell and submitted to an external force , which , once rescaled by its critical value , plays the role of @xmath37 . \n the rod creep velocity is the analogous of @xmath40 and the shear rate @xmath36 is the analogous of the rotation velocity of the inner cylinder . \n note that contrarily to the numerical set - up , the radial profile of the yield parameter @xmath33 is not homogeneous in the couette cell . \n the key observations reported in @xcite are recovered in the numerics . \n ( i ) the shear rate @xmath40 in the micro - rheometer is proportional to the shear rate @xmath36 imposed by the boundary ( fig . \n [ fig2]a ) . \n ( ii ) @xmath40 ( roughly ) decreases exponentially with the distance to the yield condition , measured by @xmath42 ( fig . \n [ fig2]b ) . \n this exponential dependence can be recovered by the non - local rheology : linearizing the constitutive relation ( [ rheononlocali ] ) around the critical state ( @xmath43 ) , the inertial number @xmath25 decays exponentially over a relaxation length @xmath44 @xcite . using the continuity of @xmath25 and @xmath45 at the interface @xmath46 \n , it is straightforward to integrate eq . \n [ rheononlocali ] @xcite . in the limit @xmath47 , \n the solution reads : @xmath48 \\!. \\qquad \\label{gammadots}\\ ] ] this solution is displayed in ( fig . \n [ fig2 ] ) and is in excellent agreement with the numerical simulation results , without any adjustable parameter , once the constitutive relation ( [ rheononlocali ] ) has been calibrated in the simple shear case . in particular , the two key properties ( i ) and ( ii ) are recovered . in conclusion , \n the exponential behaviors found either experimentally  @xcite or in the present simulations result from a linear relaxation of the shear rate . \n they do not point to a specific mechanism like mechanical activation , but to any mechanism that , like jamming , is roughly isotropic and leads to a finite non - local correction at vanishing shear rate .     as a function of the yield parameter @xmath37 in the micro - rheometer . \n ( a ) evidence for linearity of the response to the shear rate in the boundary layers @xmath36 .

local nature of the granular rheology \n , we compared the dynamics of two otherwise identical systems composed of hard and soft grains . \n the presence of localized plastic events is usually based on a visual inspection of different fields . \n the squared deviation from an affine deformation on a local scale has for instance been proposed as a field indicating plastic activity @xcite . \n however , such a quantity , as well as all those based on the non - affine velocity field , characterize fluctuations around the mean flow , and not the local contribution of a certain area to the mean flow . \n we wish here to propose a practical definition of these events , based on the quantitative criterion that they must be separated in time and localized in space . \n importantly , to match their role played in elasto - plastic models @xcite , they must also contribute additively to the average shear rate @xmath51 .    in order to detect localized plastic events , \n we have built a coarse - grained field @xmath57 reflecting , at time @xmath58 , the local contribution to @xmath51 of a small region around the position @xmath59 . \n we impose that the time average of @xmath60 must everywhere give @xmath51 . \n a coarse - graining method similar to that proposed for the stress tensor @xcite is adapted here to the computation of velocity differences \n see @xcite for the explicit expression of @xmath60 . \n we display in fig . \n [ fig4 ] for a system of rigid ( a ) and soft grains ( b ) , spatio - temporal diagrams showing the local contribution @xmath60 to the shear rate @xmath51 , measured on the central line of the cell ( without micro - rheometer , i.e. in the system schematized in fig . \n [ fig1]a ) . \n we observe contrasted behaviors in the two cases . in the soft system , \n nothing much happens most of the time , except for short periods of intense activity , associated with a cascade of plastic events . \n conversely , the hard system presents more moderate but permanent fluctuations even for asymptotically small @xmath51 .    to make these observations quantitative , fig . \n [ fig4]c shows the probability distribution function ( pdf ) over time of @xmath61 , which is the space average of @xmath60 over the cell . in panel \n ( c ) , we similarly display the pdf of the spatial standard deviation @xmath55 . \n the hard - particle system presents a narrow gaussian distribution of @xmath61 around @xmath51 , while the pdf corresponding to the soft system shows stretched tails , which are due to a very intermittent behavior associated with these plastic events ( fig . \n [ fig4]c ) . \n the pdf of @xmath55 provides informations about spatial heterogeneities in the system . \n the peak of the black line around @xmath62 in fig . \n [ fig4]d indicates that they are large and permanent in the hard system . for the soft system \n , the pdf shows an algebraic decay , which means that the field @xmath51 is homogeneous most of the time . \n however , when the computation of @xmath55 is restricted to the periods of time where plastic events occur ( periods where @xmath63 is larger than @xmath64 in fig . \n [ fig4]d ) , its pdf also presents a peak : in the soft system , plastic events are associated with a very heterogeneous field of @xmath60 . in conclusion , \n an assembly of rigid particles does not present local plastic events when sheared permanently . \n its dynamics is not intermittent but presents spatial heterogeneities . \n _ conclusion _    the study reported in this letter allows us to conclude that the non - locality in dense granular flows of rigid particles is consistent with the existence of floppy modes characterizing the jamming picture . \n the most striking observation is the lack of localized plastic events in such _ liquid _ flows . \n this seems to be in contradiction with the fact that plastic events have been observed experimentally in both soft @xcite and hard @xcite particle systems . \n however , from the jamming point of view , all these systems are _ solid _ : foams and emulsions present plastic events when they flow at high volume fraction ; a granular sample that is not prepared in the critical state by shearing is generically hyper - static , due to friction . \n this suggests that @xmath14 ( or the volume fraction ) could be the parameter controlling the cross - over between a non - local behavior ruled by the contact network geometry and another controlled by local plastic events . \n further numerical studies are required to investigate the nature of this cross - over . \n moreover , we have shown that the non - local constitutive relation proposed by bouzid et al . \n @xcite is able , without any other adjusting parameter or any assumption on the mechanisms at work , to predict the inhomogeneous fields stemming from a micro -

    "we address the use of simple quantum probes for the spectral characterization of classical noisy environments . in our scheme \n a qubit interacts with a classical stochastic field describing environmental noise and is then measured after a given interaction time in order to estimate the characteristic parameters of the noise . in particular , we address estimation of the spectral parameters of two relevant kinds of non - gaussian noise : random telegraph noise with lorentzian spectrum and colored noise with @xmath0 spectrum . \n we analyze in details the estimation precision achievable by quantum probes and prove that population measurement on the qubit is optimal for noise estimation in both cases . \n we also evaluate the optimal interaction times for the quantum probe , i.e. the values maximizing the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) and the quantum signal - to - noise ratio . for random telegraph noise \n the qfi is inversely proportional to the square of the switching rate , meaning that the quantum signal - to - noise ratio is constant and thus the switching rate may be uniformly estimated with the same precision in its whole range of variation . for colored noise , \n the precision achievable in the estimation of `` color '' , i.e. of the exponent @xmath1 , strongly depends on the structure of the environment , i.e. on the number of fluctuators describing the classical environment . \n for an environment modeled by a single random fluctuator estimation is more precise for pink noise , i.e. for @xmath2 , whereas by increasing the number of fluctuators , the quantum signal - to - noise ratio has two local maxima , with the largest one drifting towards @xmath3 , i.e. brown noise . \n in any communication channel or measurement scheme , the interaction of the information carriers with the external environment introduces noise in the system , thus degrading the overall performances . the precise characterization of the noise is thus a crucial ingredient for the design of high - precision measurements and reliable communication protocols . in many physical situations , \n the main source of noise is associated to the fluctuations of bistable quantities . in these cases , \n a suitable description of the noise is given in terms of classical stochastic processes @xcite . \n in particular , in the case of phase damping , i.e. pure dephasing , it has been shown that the interaction of a quantum system with a quantum bath can be written in terms of a random unitary evolution driven by a classical stochastic process @xcite . \n the characterization of classical noise is often performed by collecting a series of measurements to estimate the autocorrelation function and the spectral properties @xcite . \n this procedure is generally time consuming and may require the control of a complex system . \n a question thus arises on whether more effective techniques may be developed . to this purpose \n , we address the use of _ quantum probes _ to estimate the parameters of classical noise . \n we assume to have a quantum system interacting with the classical fluctuating field generating the noise and explore the performances of quantum measurements performed at a fixed interaction time to extract information about the classical noise . \n the power and implications of this idea are undeniable : the features of a complex system may be determined by monitoring a small probe , which is usually characterized by few and easily controllable degrees of freedom . \n the simplest and paradigmatic example of this situation is that of a qubit interacting with a noisy environment . \n after a given interaction time , which may be suitably optimized , quantum - limited measurements on the qubit may be used to characterize the environment , e.g. to estimate the parameters describing its noise spectrum .    in this paper \n we focus on the characterization of two classes of classical noise : random telegraph noise ( rtn ) with lorentzian spectrum and the power - law @xmath0 _ colored _ spectra arising from the interaction with a collection of random bistable fluctuators . \n both rtn and colored noise are examples of classical non - gaussian noise occurring in several system of interest . \n indeed , the microscopic models underlying these kinds of noise have been extensively analyzed in the literature @xcite . \n the relevant parameters characterizing this kinds of noise are the switching rate of the rtn and the exponent @xmath1 in the case of power - law spectra . \n both quantities do not correspond to observables in a strict sense and therefore we have to resort to indirect measurements performed on the quantum probe to infer their value . in order to optimize this inference procedure \n we employ tools from local quantum estimation theory @xcite , which have already been proved useful in the estimation of static noise parameters @xcite and in several other scenarios , as for example the estimation of quantum correlations @xcite , gaussian states @xcite , optical phase @xcite , critical systems @xcite and quantum thermometry @xcite . \n in particular , we will optimize the initial preparation of the qubit and the interaction time in order to maximize the quantum fisher information and the quantum signal - to - noise ratio . \n furthermore , we show that population measurement provides optimal inference for both the noise models . \n this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec1 ] we introduce the physical dephasing model employed throughout the paper and describe the main features of rtn and colored noise . in section [ sec2 ] \n we briefly review the main tools of quantum estimation theory , whereas in section [ sec3 ] we present our results on the precision achievable by quantum probes in the estimation of the spectral properties of noisy random environments . \n section [ sec4 ] closes the paper with concluding remarks .",

consequently , such reactions probe the short range dynamics of the baryon - baryon system . as a consequence , \n meson - exchange calculations at such large momentum transfers are in general not dominated by the single pion - exchange : for a quantitative description , the exchange of all mesons with masses up to typically 1 gev , i.e. , the exchange of the goldstone bosons @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , of the vector mesons @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and of the @xmath12-dominated scalar mesons @xmath13 and @xmath14 have to be included explicitly @xcite . \n as the relative phases and the form factors of the corresponding meson-@xmath0 vertices are in general unknown , even in the cleanest single - meson production reaction , such as the near - threshold @xmath7 and @xmath15 production , which are dominated , respectively , by the excitation of the @xmath3(1535 ) and @xmath3(1650 ) resonances @xcite , the model predictions depend sensitively on the _ ad hoc _ interplay between the various meson exchanges @xcite . \n examples for near - threshold @xmath7-production show a characteristic uncertainty up to one order of magnitude in exploring the relative phases between the different mesons@xcite . an additional , equally drastic uncertainty is the highly unknown behavior of the different meson - baryon transition vertices if continued far off - shell into the space - like region . \n + of course , there are prescriptions in the literature , specifying both diagonal and non - diagonal mesonic nucleon couplings to baryon resonances with arbitrary spins and positive or negative parity , and the relative phases between different meson - induced transition vertices @xcite . for the transition to negative parity , \n spin 1/2 , baryon resonances , which we investigate in this note , i.e. for @xmath16 @xmath17 vertices ( @xmath18 denotes scalar , pseudo - scalar or vector mesons ) , the standard recipe is to start from the @xmath19 vertices - which are expected to be well understood from experimental evidence , such as from nn scattering at low energies @xcite - and add for the transition vertices the negative parity operator @xmath20 , yielding a well defined scheme for the relative mesonic couplings ( of course , the strength of various vertices on and off shell remains completely open ) . \n already at first inspection such a procedure may be ambiguous depending on the explicit order of implementation relative to the dirac matrices in the @xmath19 vertices ( while , for example , the extension of the pseudo - scalar ( ps ) @xmath21 vertex to @xmath22 is unambiguous , however , a sign ambiguity may already arise for the pv vertex from @xmath23 ( the absolute coupling constants are related by the equivalence theorem for the baryons on their mass shell @xcite ) ; similarly on the su(3 ) level mesonic vertices involve d and f components , implying different phases for the @xmath16 vertices @xcite . \n + in this note we would like to investigate these questions , i. e. the relative phases of the different meson exchanges and the structure of the meson - nn@xmath24 transition form factors in a quark - diquark model for the baryons . in the following chapter \n we derive the corresponding formalism ;

the most extensive investigations for the coupling to non strange baryon resonances were obtained from a self - consistent coupled channel approach to hadron and/or @xmath26-induced meson production on the nucleon @xcite or from a detailed analysis within the non relativistic constituent quark model @xcite . however \n , opposite to the last reference , it seems questionable to fix in a fairly model independent way the vertices @xmath25 , which still involve an overall arbitrary phase for the various resonances ; only the coupling to a given resonance is well defined with respect to the phases in @xmath19 , which are fairly well known . \n thus we focus here on a specific resonance , the @xmath27 and investigate the relative phases of selected @xmath16 couplings and the t - channel continuation of the coupling constants ( the same conclusions hold for the @xmath28 resonance ) . as we aim to apply our findings in a next step to meson exchange models at high momentum transfers up to 1 gev / c \n , our emphasis is to estimate form factors for the off - shell continuation in a ( at least approximately ) covariant , but still economical way . for this end \n , we compromise on our quark representation of the interacting hadrons : we represent baryons as quark - diquark objects @xcite , keeping in this work only the scalar - isoscalar component . for our purpose \n such an approximation seems well justified : different investigations show a strong dominance of the scalar component for the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon up to ( and beyond ) momentum transfers of 1 gev / c ; in the same momentum range axial diquarks renormalize magnetic form factors , having , however , no significant influence on their momentum spectrum @xcite ) . \n as the form factors derived show a smooth momentum spectrum ( see the discussion below ) , minor modifications of axial diquarks are readily taken into account in a slight renormalized range parameter for the quark - diquark wave function . \n in addition , as a main advantage , lorentz boosts are easily incorporated in a purely scalar diquark picture ( the incorporation of lorentz boosts is still matter of discussion in the literature @xcite ) . \n the mesons we still treat as elementary objects , which couple directly to the q - ( qq ) system ( one may include a phenomenological form factor to simulate their finite extension ) . \n we expect that our treatment of the meson fields is qualitatively acceptable , as we do not aim at absolute predictions of @xmath16 parameters , but develop simple scaling rules for the n@xmath24 vertices , by exploring their structure relative to the ground - state baryon , i.e. , the nucleon . for the baryons , the quark - diquark representation allows to incorporate approximate covariance beyond non - relativistic potential models , being able to include lorentz - quenching in the radial wave function and the modification of the small component , which enters explicitly into the leading non - relativistic reduction of the vertices . \n explicitly we work within harmonic confinement , yielding for the @xmath2 and the @xmath29 resonances , which are assumed to be pure p - shell excitations of a single quark@xcite ,    @xmath3000 > _ c\\ ] ]    and @xmath31 1/2,\\mu^*>_s|\\ ! 1/2 , 1/2>_t \\!|\\ !

the momentum dependence in the fall off reflects only the moderately different baryon size parameters ( note that we still keep the meson as point - like objects ) . \n the influence of lorentz - quenching is significant : it enhances the ratio @xmath117 without quenching by typically a factor of 2 ; the effective size parameter varies from its value @xmath39 for a nucleon at rest to    @xmath118    for @xmath119 ( fig.(2.b ) ) . \n + a quantitatively different structure is found for the pseudo - scalar and the space - like vector - meson @xmath0 vertices ( fig.(5 ) ) : while exponentially they exhibit a similar , gaussian - dominated behavior such as the scalar and time - like vector form factors , their overall momentum spectrum is enhanced : the overlap of the p - wave in the @xmath3 with the pseudo scalar ( p - wave ) operator , adds a @xmath120 to the overlap integral of the form factors , which leads to a typical momentum dependence ( for @xmath121 )    @xmath122    of course , for a quantitative insight into the structure of the different form factors a more realistic calculation is necessary .    * \n iv . \n summary and outlook * + summarizing our brief report , we formulated the dominant meson-@xmath1 and meson-@xmath0 vertices in a simple quark - diquark model for baryons , together with the assumption of the coupling of mesons as elementary objects ( a philosophy which strongly resembles the spirit of the quark - coupling - models @xcite ) . \n we extract both the relative phases between the @xmath16 vertices ( for p - wave dominated @xmath123 resonances ) and the momentum spectra of the hadronic form factors for momenta up to 1 gev / c . for our findings \n we feel on a safe ground for the relative phases of the coupling constants , however , the hadronic form factors should be improved in the light of more sophisticated representations for @xmath124 resonances ( we remark , however , that in contrast to the merits of our simple two - body representation of baryons the resolution into 3 quarks immediately raises the well known problems of center - of - mass corrections and lorentz - quenching @xcite ) . \n we expect that with continuous and sophisticated data from hadron and electron factories a much more profound understanding of the nature of baryon resonances may be gained in the near future . \n + in this note we did not address a further serious problem for the relative phases of the various meson exchange : i.e. the coupling of the @xmath3 vertices to the meson - nucleon continuum above the pion threshold . \n we are presently investigating this aspect - which gives rise to complex form factors - in a simple perturbative model , hoping for a more consistent understanding of meson - baryon vertices and thus of the structure @xmath3 resonances high in the continuum of the nucleon@xcite . \n 2.0 cm    * appendix * + here we collect the different overlap integrals for the hadronic form factors . \n @xmath125    @xmath126    @xmath127    @xmath128    @xmath129    with    @xmath130    ( for the @xmath3 vertices @xmath131 has to be replaced by @xmath132 in @xmath133 ) . \n 99 t. walcher : nucl . phys . \n * a50 * ( 2005 ) 185 ;

parameter field . \n relative homotopy groups provide a useful tool for characterizing effects when the order - parameter manifold changes its character on a surface or when it is constrained by boundary conditions . \n relative homotopy groups can also be used to discuss properties of a defect that is itself regarded as a singularity in the order - parameter field in ordinary homotopy theory . \n finally , the relative homotopy group is useful to calculate the absolute homotopy group via the exact sequence of homomorphisms .    as an illustrative example , let us again consider a ferromagnetic bec . \n suppose that the system is contained in a cylinder of radius @xmath0 and impose a boundary condition that the spin points in the positive @xmath1-direction at @xmath2 and outward or downward on the wall at @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the radial coordinate . \n then , the spin texture would look like @xmath5 \\frac{e^{i\\varphi}}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\sin \\beta(r ) \\\\[1 mm ] e^{2i\\varphi } \\sin^2 \\frac{\\beta(r)}{2 } \\end{pmatrix}. \\label{m - h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because the direction of spin is @xmath6 , the above boundary conditions are met if we choose @xmath7 and @xmath8 or @xmath9 . \n the topological objects corresponding to @xmath8 and @xmath9 are referred to as the mermin - ho vortex and anderson - toulouse vortex , respectively . \n it can be shown that the circulation at the wall is 1 for the mermin - ho vortex and 2 for the anderson - toulouse vortex . \n they are good examples of relative homotopy because both of them are not stable in free space and they can be stabilized only if the boundary conditions on the wall are imposed by some means .    in general , the @xmath10th relative homotopy group @xmath11 consists of the elements of @xmath12 from which those of @xmath13 are subtracted . \n we consider an @xmath10-sphere in @xmath14 and let it expand into @xmath15 by continuous deformation . \n such an expansion may be regarded as a one - to - one mapping of @xmath13 into a subgroup of @xmath12 . \n let im@xmath16 be the image of this homomorphism . \n then , by the definition given above , the relative homotopy @xmath11 is a quotient group of @xmath17 in @xmath12 : @xmath18    the relative first homotopy group @xmath19 can cope with planar defects with nontrivial boundaries . \n a well - known example is a planar soliton ( maki domain wall ) in the a phase of superfluid helium-3 , where the order - parameter manifold is @xmath20 within a dipole healing length from the domain wall and @xmath21 outside this layer due to dipole locking . \n the domain wall may be regarded as a linear defect as seen from the edge of the wall . \n we take the axis perpendicular to the domain wall as the @xmath1-axis . \n then , the order - parameter field defines a mapping from the @xmath1-axis into the contour in @xmath15 whose end points belong to @xmath14 . because @xmath22 , such contours are also classified as @xmath23 , of which the nontrivial one corresponds to the maki domain wall . \n the relative second homotopy group @xmath19 allows the stabilization of a point object subject to a boundary condition on a sphere enclosing it . \n another example is the boojum  a point defect that appears in the a phase of superfluid helium-3 when it is contained in a hard - wall sphere . because @xmath24 , the bulk superfluid a phase does not support a topologically stable point defect . \n however , because the @xmath25 vector must be perpendicular to the surface , a point singularity for the @xmath25-vector appears on the surface that is connected to a nonsingular vortex texture in the bulk . \n the line defects are characterized by the first homotopy group ( or the fundamental group ) @xmath26 . for the case of _ \n s_-wave superconductors , liquid helium-4 , and spin - polarized or spinless gaseous becs , the order parameter is scalar and the order - parameter manifold is @xmath27 . \n the fundamental group is therefore the additive group of integers : @xmath28    for the case of a spin-1 bec , the ground state can be ferromagnetic or polar . \n the order - parameter manifold of the ferromagnetic phase is so(3 ) and the fundamental group is @xmath29 , the two - element group . \n the spin configuration that corresponds to class 0 is continuously transformable to a uniform configuration , whereas the spin configuration that corresponds to class 1 describes a singly quantized vortex that is topologically stable . because 1 + 1 = 0 in @xmath30 , the coalescence of two singly quantized vortices is homotopic to a uniform configuration . \n conversely , there is a configuration called the anderson - toulouse vortex that is nonsingular at the origin but has circulation of two away from the origin . \n next , let us consider the polar phase of a spin-1 bec . \n the order - parameter manifold is @xmath31/({\\mathbb z}_2)_{{\\bm f},\\phi}$ ] . as we have discussed in sec . \n [ sec : sym_opm ] , the @xmath32 symmetry arises from the fact that the order parameter given by eq . \n is invariant under the simultaneous transformation of @xmath33 . \n because @xmath34 is not simply connected , to calculate @xmath35 , we lift @xmath36 to @xmath37 and use eq .  . \n then , the points that are identical to @xmath38 in @xmath39 are @xmath40 for even @xmath10 and @xmath41 for odd @xmath10 , and those points constitute an additive group of integers @xmath10 . \n hence , we have @xmath42 as in the case of a scalar bec , vortices in the polar phase are classified by integers . \n however , due to the @xmath32 discrete symmetry , the minimum unit of circulation is one - half of the usual value of @xmath43 , as discussed in sec . \n [ sec : vortex_spin1polar ] .    in a similar manner \n , we may expect that the uniaxial , biaxial , and cyclic phases in spin-2 spinor becs can support various types of vortices due to the discrete symmetry , as discussed in sec . \n [ sec : vortices ] . \n some of them have fractional circulations , and some others have no mass circulation . \n the topological charge can be expressed algebraically as a functional of the order - parameter field . the topological charge corresponding to @xmath44 \n can be expressed as a line integral of the velocity field . \n point defects are characterized by the second homotopy group . because @xmath45 , scalar becs have no topologically stable point defects . \n when the order - parameter manifold is @xmath46 , it can host monopoles because @xmath47 .    here \n , we consider the situation shown in fig . \n [ fig : homotopy3 ] , where @xmath48 is a mapping from @xmath46 to @xmath46 . \n the topological charge @xmath49 of the point defect can be calculated as follows . by definition \n , @xmath49 gives the number of times the vector @xmath48 shown in fig . \n [ fig : homotopy3 ] wraps @xmath46 . expressing the components of this vector in spherical coordinate as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 \n , we can calculate @xmath49 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the spherical coordinates of @xmath57 , and the last term on the right - hand side is the jacobian of the transformation of the coordinates . \n the fact that the integrand is the jacobian explicitly indicates that @xmath49 gives the degree of mapping from @xmath46 in real space to @xmath46 in order - parameter space . the right - hand side of eq . \n ( [ n_2 ] ) can be directly expressed in terms of @xmath58 as @xmath59 where @xmath60 we can use gauss law to rewrite the right - hand side of eq . \n ( [ n_22 ] ) as a volume integral : @xmath61 where @xmath62 gives the density distribution of point singularities . + * t - hooft - polyakov monopole ( hedgehog ) *    next , we consider the polar phase . \n the second homotopy group is given by @xmath63 , and therefore , it can accommodate point defects . to investigate their nature , we write the order parameter in the following form : @xmath64 by setting @xmath65 , we obtain the spherical monopole called t - hooft - polyakov monopole or hedgehog : @xmath66 it follows from eq .   that the topological charge of the hedgehog is @xmath67 . \n moreover , @xmath68 defined in eq . \n is related to the circulation of spin currents given by eq .   as @xmath69 which implies that the surface integral of the spin circulation is quantized in terms of @xmath70 \n ; @xmath71 + * alice ring *    the monopole in the spin-1 polar phase is energetically unstable against deformation into an alice ring  @xcite . \n the alice ring is a combined object of two defects characterized by @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( see fig . \n [ fig : homotopy7 ] ) . \n viewed far from the origin , it appears to be a point defect ( @xmath67 ) ; however , along the ring @xmath74 on which the order parameter is singular , it appears to be a continuous distribution of line defects ( @xmath75 ) . \n this topological object is called the alice ring , and it has been predicted to be realized in an optically trapped spin-1 @xmath76na bec  @xcite . \n +    * dirac monopole *    the magnetic monopole was originally envisaged as a magnetic analogue of the quantized electric charge : @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the strength of the magnetic monopole . \n the solution of this equation is easily found to be @xmath79 and the corresponding vector potential is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 are the polar coordinates and @xmath82 is the unit vector in the @xmath83-direction . \n the vector potential ( [ vectora ] ) reproduces the magnetic field ( [ bfield ] ) , except on the positive @xmath1-axis along which the magnetic field exhibits a singularity called the dirac string : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the unit vector along the @xmath1-direction . \n the dirac monopole can be created in the ferromagnetic phase of a spin-1 bec  @xcite . \n substituting @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 in eq . \n ( [ eqscb88 ] ) , we obtain @xmath89 \\frac{e^{-i\\varphi}}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\sin\\theta \\\\[1 mm ]               \\sin^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2}. \\end{pmatrix } \\label{dirac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding superfluid velocity @xmath90 [ defined by eq .  ] \n is the same as the vector potential ( [ vectora ] ) of the dirac monopole with the identification @xmath91 . \n it is interesting to note that the order parameter ( [ dirac ] ) exhibits a doubly quantized vortex only along the positive @xmath1-axis . \n one can say that because the first homotopy group of so(3 ) is @xmath32 , which allows only a singly quantized vortex called a polar - core vortex as a stable topological object , the doubly quantized vortex must terminate at the magnetic monopole . \n in fact , the singular dirac monopole can deform continuously to a nonsingular spin texture if we take the following parametrization : @xmath92 \\frac{e^{-i\\varphi}}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\sin\\beta \\\\[1 mm ]               \\sin^2 \\frac{\\beta}{2 } \\end{pmatrix } , \\ \\ \n \\ \\beta(r,\\varphi , z)=\\theta ( 1-t)+\\pi t. \\label{dirac2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can see that as @xmath93 increases from 0 to 1 , the order parameter continuously changes from the dirac monopole at @xmath94 to a nonsingular texture @xmath95 at @xmath96 .      when two different types of topological objects coexist , there exists an action of one object on the other as they move relative to each other . as an example , consider a spin-1 polar phase in which two monopoles with charge 1 merge in the presence of a half - quantum vortex . \n as a monopole turns around the vortex , it changes sign . \n thus , if they merge along line 1 , the order - parameter field must deform , as shown in fig .  [ \n fig : homotopy9 ]  ( b ) , and the combined object has the topological charge of two . on the other hand , when they merge along line 2 , the order - parameter manifold can deform into the one shown in fig . \n [ fig : homotopy9 ]  ( c ) , and the topological charge is zero , indicating that the two monopoles annihilate in pairs . \n this example illustrates that the charge of the monopole changes its sign as it moves around the half - quantum vortex along curve 2 .      * \n shankar skyrmion *    the third homotopy group characterizes topological objects called skyrmions that extend over the entire three - dimensional space . \n a prime example of this is the so - called shankar monopole  @xcite , although it is actually not a monopole but a skyrmion . \n the topology of the shankar skyrmion is @xmath97 , which is supported by the ferromagnetic phase of a spin-1 bec . \n the order parameter of the ferromagnetic bec is characterized by the direction of the local spin @xmath98 and the superfluid phase that can be parametrized in terms of two unit vectors such as @xmath99 and @xmath100 that form a triad with @xmath101 : @xmath102 . \n concrete forms of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are introduced in sec . \n [ sec : vortex_spin1ferro ] .    the class one element of @xmath97 may be realized by rotating the triad at position @xmath57 about the direction  @xcite @xmath103 through an angle @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 . \n it follows from the last condition that the triad is uniform in spatial infinity , and thus , the three - dimensional space is compacted to @xmath107 . \n the case of @xmath108 is shown in fig . \n [ fig : homotopy8 ] . \n the topological charge of the third homotopy group can be introduced in a manner similar to that of the second homotopy group . \n now , the mapped vector has a four - component vector that is normalized to unity . \n one such representation is @xmath109 the invariant of such a mapping is again given by the jacobian of the transformations : @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the completely antisymmetric tensors of the third and fourth orders , respectively , and the roman letters run over @xmath113 and the greek letters run over @xmath114 . + * knot soliton *    the third homotopy group also classifies knot solitons . \n knots differ from other topological excitations such as vortices , monopoles , and shankar monopoles in that they are classified by a linking number while others are classified by winding numbers . \n knots are characterized by mappings from a three - dimensional sphere @xmath107 to @xmath46 . as in the case of shankar monopoles , \n the @xmath107 domain is prepared by imposing a boundary condition that the order parameter takes on the same value in every direction at spatial infinity . here , we consider the spin-1 polar phase  @xcite . \n the order parameter manifold of the polar phase is given by @xmath115 , of which neither @xmath116 nor @xmath32 symmetry contributes to the homotopy groups in spaces higher than one dimension ; hence , we find that @xmath117 . \n the associated integer topological charge @xmath118 is known as the hopf charge , and it is given by @xmath119 where @xmath120  @xcite . \n note that the domain ( @xmath57 ) is three - dimensional , while the target space ( @xmath121 ) is two - dimensional . \n consequently , the preimage of a point on the target @xmath46 constitutes a closed loop in @xmath107 , and the hopf charge is interpreted as the linking number of these loops : if the @xmath121 field has hopf charge @xmath118 , two loops corresponding to the preimages of any two distinct points on the target @xmath46 will be linked @xmath118 times [ see fig . \n [ fig : knot_preimage ] ( a ) ] . \n figure  [ fig : knot_preimage ] ( b ) shows an example of the @xmath121 field of a polar bec with hopf charge 1 ( b ) is an _ unknot _ of a pair of rings with linking number 1 , because the preimage of one point on @xmath46 forms a simple unknotted ring . ] . \n knots can be created by manipulating an external magnetic field . in the presence of an external magnetic field \n , the linear zeeman effect causes the larmor precession of @xmath121 , whereas @xmath121 tends to become parallel to the magnetic field because of the quadratic zeeman effect . \n suppose that we prepare an optically trapped bec in the @xmath122 state , i.e. , @xmath123 , by applying a uniform magnetic field in the @xmath1-direction . \n then , we suddenly turn off the uniform field and switch on a quadrupole field . because of the linear zeeman effect \n , @xmath121 starts rotating around the local magnetic field , and therefore , the @xmath121 field winds as a function of @xmath93 , resulting in the formation of knots . \n figure  [ fig : knottime ] shows the creation dynamics of knots in an optical trap subject to the quadrupole field , where the upper panels show the snapshots of the preimages of @xmath124 and @xmath125 and the bottom panels show cross sections of the density for @xmath126 ( bottom ) components on the @xmath127 plane . \n the density pattern in @xmath126 components is characteristic of knots ; a double - ring pattern appears corresponding to one knot . \n as the @xmath121 field winds in the dynamics , the number of rings increases . \n this prediction can be tested by the stern - gerlach experiment . \n topological objects are conjectured to play important roles in the formation of our universe . among them , knot solitons have recently attracted the interest of cosmologists since faddeev and niemi suggested that knots might exist as stable solitons in a three - dimensional classical field theory  @xcite .",

    "new measurements and reaction model calculations are reported for single neutron pickup reactions onto a fast secondary beam at 84 mev per nucleon . \n measurements were made on both carbon and beryllium targets , having very different structures , allowing a first investigation of the likely nature of the pickup reaction mechanism . \n the measurements involve thick reaction targets and @xmath0-ray spectroscopy of the projectile - like reaction residue for final - state resolution , that permit experiments with low incident beam rates compared to traditional low - energy transfer reactions . from measured longitudinal momentum distributions \n we show that the @xmath1 reaction largely proceeds as a direct two - body reaction , the neutron transfer producing bound target residues . \n the corresponding reaction on the target seems to largely leave the residual nucleus unbound at excitation energies high in the continuum . \n we discuss the possible use of such fast - beam one - neutron pickup reactions to track single - particle strength in exotic nuclei , and also their expected sensitivity to neutron high-@xmath2 ( intruder ) states which are often direct indicators of shell evolution and the disappearance of magic numbers in the exotic regime .",
    "inversion asymmetry induced spin splitting of the electron states in quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems can be attributed to an effective magnetic field @xmath0 which varies in magnitude and orientation as a function of the in - plane wave vector @xmath1 . using a realistic @xmath2 kane model that fully takes into account spin splitting because of both bulk inversion asymmetry and structure inversion asymmetry we investigate the spin orientation and the effective field @xmath0 for different configurations of a quasi 2d electron system . \n it is shown that these quantities depend sensitively on the crystallographic direction in which the quasi 2d system was grown as well as on the magnitude and orientation of the in - plane wave vector @xmath1 . \n these results are used to discuss how spin - polarized electrons can precess in the field @xmath3 . as a specific example we consider ga@xmath4in@xmath5as - inp quantum wells .",
    "we present a simple model of the infra - red universe , based as much as possible on local observations . \n we model the luminosity and number evolution of disk and starburst galaxies , including the effects of dust , gas and spectral evolution . \n although simple , our approach is able to reproduce observations of galaxy number counts and the infra - red and sub - millimeter extra - galactic backgrounds . \n it provides a useful probe of galaxy formation and evolution out to high redshift . \n the model demonstrates the significant role of the starburst population and predicts high star formation rates at @xmath0 3 to 4 , consistent with recent extinction - corrected observations of lyman break galaxies . \n starbursting galaxies are predicted to dominate the current scuba surveys . \n their star formation is driven predominantly by strong tidal interactions and mergers of galaxies . \n this leads to the creation of spheroidal stellar systems , which may act as the seeds for disk formation as gas infalls . \n we predict the present - day baryonic mass in bulges and halos is comparable to that in disks . from observations of the extra - galactic background , \n the model predicts that the vast majority of star formation in the universe occurs at @xmath1 .",
    "we propose a phenomenological model for the scattering of particles on space - time defects in a treatment that maintains lorentz - invariance on the average . \n the local defects considered here cause a stochastic violation of momentum conservation . \n the scattering probability is parameterized in the density of defects and the distribution of the momentum that a particle can obtain when scattering on the defect . \n we identify the most promising observable consequences and derive constraints from existing data .",
    "since the launch of the fermi gamma - ray space telescope on 11 june 2008 , significant detections of high energy emission have been reported only in six gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) until now . in this work we show that the lack of detection of a gev spectrum excess in almost all grbs , though somewhat surprisingly , can be well understood within the standard internal shock model and several alternatives like the photosphere - internal shock ( gradual magnetic dissipation ) model and the magnetized internal shock model . \n the delay of the arrival of the @xmath0 mev photons from some fermi bursts can be interpreted too . \n we then show that with the polarimetry of prompt emission these models may be distinguishable . in the magnetized internal shock model \n , high linear polarization level should be typical . in the standard internal shock model , \n high linear polarization level is still possible but much less frequent . in the photosphere - internal shock model , the linear polarization degree \n is expected to be roughly anti - correlated with the weight of the photosphere / thermal component , which may be a unique signature of this kind of model . \n we also briefly discuss the implication of the current fermi grb data on the detection prospect of the prompt pev neutrinos . \n the influences of the intrinsic proton spectrum and the enhancement of the neutrino number at some specific energies , due to the cooling of pions ( muons ) , are outlined . \n [ firstpage ]    gamma rays : bursts @xmath1 polarization @xmath1 radiation mechanism : nonthermal @xmath1 acceleration of particles @xmath1 elementary particles : neutrino",
    "we extend the 3-point intrinsic alignment self - calibration technique to the gravitational shear - intrinsic ellipticity - intrinsic ellipticity ( gii ) bispectrum . the proposed technique will allow the measurement and removal of the gii intrinsic alignment contamination from the cross - correlation weak lensing signal . \n while significantly decreased from using cross - correlations instead of auto - correlation in a single photo - z bin , the gii contamination persists in adjacent photo - z bins and must be accounted for and removed from the lensing signal . \n we relate the gii and galaxy density - intrinsic ellipticity - intrinsic ellipticity ( gii ) bispectra through use of the galaxy bias , and develop the estimator necessary to isolate the gii bispectrum from observations . \n we find that the gii self - calibration technique performs at a level comparable to that of the gravitational shear - gravitational shear - intrinsic ellipticity correlation ( ggi ) self - calibration technique , with measurement error introduced through the gii estimator generally negligible when compared to minimum survey error . \n the accuracy of the relationship between the gii and gii bispectra typically allows the gii self - calibration to reduce the gii contamination by a factor of 10 or more for all adjacent photo - z bin combinations at @xmath0 . for larger scales , we find that the gii contamination can be reduced by a factor of 3 - 5 or more . \n the gii self - calibration technique is complementary to the existing ggi self - calibration technique , which together will allow the total intrinsic alignment cross - correlation signal in 3-point weak lensing to be measured and removed . \n [ firstpage ]    gravitational lensing  cosmology",
    "we study the single - particle density of states of one - dimensional and two - dimensional quantum disordered systems with long - range interactions . \n we consider a @xmath0 interaction in one dimension and a coulomb interaction in two dimensions , which produce linear gaps in the density of states in both cases . \n we focus on the strong localization regime where the localization length is small but non - zero . \n we use an exact diagonalization technique for small system sizes and a perturbation approach for larger sizes . \n we find that , with both methods , the inclusion of a finite hopping contribution does not change the linear character of the gap , but reduces its slope , widening the gap .",

    "we give a complete factorization of the invariant factors of resultant matrices built from birational parameterizations of rational plane curves in terms of the singular points of the curve and their multiplicity graph . \n this allows us to prove the validity of some conjectures about these invariants stated by chen , wang and liu . as a byproduct \n , we also give a complete factorization of the @xmath0-resultant for rational functions in terms of the similar data extracted from the multiplicities .",
    "we present a comprehensive catalog of 700 confirmed star clusters in the field of m31 compiled from three major existing catalogs . \n we detect 418 and 257 star clusters in _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( @xmath0 ) near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) and far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) imaging , respectively . \n our final catalog includes photometry of star clusters in up to 16 passbands ranging from fuv to nir as well as ancillary information such as reddening , metallicity , and radial velocities . in particular , this is the most extensive and updated catalog of uv integrated photometry for m31 star clusters . \n ages and masses of star clusters are derived by fitting the multi - band photometry with model spectral energy distribution ( sed ) ; uv photometry enables more accurate age estimation of young clusters . \n our catalog includes 182 young clusters with ages less than 1  gyr . \n our estimated ages and masses of young clusters are in good agreement with previously determined values in the literature . the mean age and mass of young clusters \n are about 300  myr and 10@xmath1 , respectively . \n we found that the compiled [ fe / h ] values of young clusters included in our catalog are systematically lower ( by more than 1  dex ) than those from recent high - quality spectroscopic data and our sed fitting result . \n we confirm that most of the young clusters kinematics show systematic rotation around the minor axis and association with the thin disk of m31 . \n the young clusters distribution exhibits a distinct peak in the m31 disk around 10 - 12  kpc from the center and follow a spatial distributions similar to other tracers of disk structure such as ob stars , uv star - forming regions , and dust . \n some young clusters also show concentration around the ring splitting regions found in the southern part of the m31 disk and most of them have systematically younger ( @xmath2 100  myr ) ages . considering the kinematical properties and spatial distribution of young clusters \n , they might be associated with the well - known 10  kpc star - formation ring structure in the m31 disk . \n consequently , we suggest that various properties of young clusters in m31 might be in line with the scenarios that a satellite galaxy had passed through the disk of m31 less than few hundred million years ago .",

    "we comment on zero- and low - temperature structural phase transitions , expecting that these comments might be relevant not only for this structural case . \n we first consider a textbook model whose classical version is the only model for which the landau theory of phase transitions and the concept of `` soft mode '' introduced by ginzburg are exact . within this model \n , we reveal the effects of quantum fluctuations and thermal ones at low temperatures . \n to do so , the knowledge of the dynamics of the model is needed . however , as already was emphasized by ginzburg _ \n et al . \n _ in eighties , a realistic theory for such a dynamics at high temperatures is lacking , what also seems to be the case in the low temperature regime . \n consequently , some theoretical conclusions turn out to be dependent on the assumptions on this dynamics . \n we illustrate this point with the low - temperature phase diagram , and discuss some unexpected shortcomings of the continuous medium approaches .",
