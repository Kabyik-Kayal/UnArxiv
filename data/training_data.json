    "input": "in order to extend the spectral action principle to non - compact spaces , we propose a framework for spectral triples where the algebra may be non - unital but the resolvent of the dirac operator remains compact . \n we show that an example is given by the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator which , interestingly , provides two different dirac operators . \n this leads to two different representations of the volume form in the hilbert space , and only their product is the grading operator . \n the index of the even - to - odd part of each of these dirac operators is @xmath0 . \n we also compute the spectral action for the corresponding connes - lott two - point model . \n there is an additional harmonic oscillator potential for the higgs field , whereas the yang - mills part is unchanged . \n the total higgs potential shows a two - phase structure with smooth transition between them : in the spontaneously broken phase below a critical radius , all fields are massive , with the higgs field mass slightly smaller than the ncg prediction . in the unbroken phase above the critical radius , gauge fields and fermions are massless , \n whereas the higgs field remains massive .",
    "output": "Imagine zooming in on a shape that stretches out forever—like an endless road. Physicists like to study such “non-compact” spaces, but their favorite math tool, the “spectral action,” was built only for neat, finite shapes. We give it new travel papers.  \n\nWe keep the algebra (the rule book for multiplying functions) open-ended, yet insist the Dirac operator—think of it as a universal speedometer—still packs its data into a small suitcase (its resolvent stays compact).  \n\nA simple toy model, the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator (a fancy pendulum that can vibrate two ways), fits the bill. It supplies two different speedometers; each slices the space differently, and only their combined reading tells left from right.  \n\nComputing the action for a tiny two-point universe shows the Higgs field feeling an extra spring force. Below a critical size everything is heavy; above it, only the Higgs keeps its weight while the others go massless. The switch is smooth, like water turning from liquid to vapor at one temperature.  \n\nThis shows how geometry size can trigger phase changes, giving us a fresh window into why particles might gain or lose mass."

    "output": "Imagine that the “fine-structure constant,” a basic dial that controls how atoms hold together, has stayed the same since the Big Bang. Earlier studies using quirky quasar light claimed the dial has turned a tiny amount, but their error bars were unrealistically small. We built a cleaner ruler, applied it to one of the sharpest star-light spectra ever taken, and now say: if the dial has moved at all, the shift is smaller than 1 part in 10 million. We also checked a related dial—the proton-to-electron mass ratio—by looking at molecular hydrogen shadows in another quasar, and we tightened that limit too. Why care? If these dials ever shifted, our laws of physics would change across the universe. By tightening the bounds we sharpen our test of whether today’s physics is truly universal, and we show that future ultra-precise instruments could reach the sensitivity needed for a decisive check."

associated fluid , such as nitrogen , is mainly ruled by the structural relaxation , as manifested by the positive sound dispersion . \n in contrast , in the supercritical phase , the role of the structural relaxation becomes negligible and the most evident dispersive effect is the bending down of the apparent dispersion , from its adiabatic value to the isothermal one . in this regime \n , the thermal relaxation process rules the high frequency dynamics .",

The catch: each “ear” also makes its own random internal noise we can’t switch off. To prove the hum is real, scientists compare the two ears; only true sky-gone ripples will match up. Yet if both ears coincidentally “rustle” in sync, we could be fooled.  \n\nWe found a neat trick: swivel one ear. Real sky waves and local rustle respond differently to the swivel, so their mixed signal changes in different ways. Watching this change lets us spot and subtract the rustle, keeping only the cosmic hum.  \n\nThis swivel test was tried on the ALLEGRO–LIGO Livingston pair and showed it can cleanly separate the hum from the rustle. Knowing how to remove such hidden noise sharpens our ability to finally hear—or rule out—the long-sought gravitational-wave background, giving us a clearer window into the universe’s quiet side."

    "output": "Sunspots are dark blotches on the Sun where strong magnetism pokes through the surface. Around each spot sits a brighter, streaky rim called a penumbra. These streaks only appear where the magnetic field is leaning over like a fallen fence post, yet nobody knew why the leaning field gathers in a neat circle opposite the spot’s “birthplace.”  \n\nWe ran a movie-like computer model of a twisted magnetic rope rising from deep inside the Sun. The movie shows that as the rope breaks the surface, its top layers naturally flop outward and create a floppy magnetic “umbrella.” This umbrella parks itself exactly where penumbrae later show up.  \n\nIn short, the leaning field isn’t dragged in later—it’s built in from the start by the way the magnetic rope unfurls. Knowing this helps us predict how sunspots and their storms will grow, making space-weather forecasts a little less surprising."

We do it by adding a gentle dip in the trap that concentrates them. The dip is only 0.2 micrometers wide, so the atoms feel a tighter squeeze, bump into each other more, and suddenly condense. We call it the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) - a new state of matter where atoms behave as a single entity. We studied how this transformation works, both fast and slow, for a range of dip widths and depths. We found good agreement with equilibrium calculations based on self-consistent semiclassical Hartree-Fock theory describing the condensate and thermal cloud. We also observed an optimal dip depth that maximizes the condensate fraction.

    "output": "Imagine a pot of water cooling so fast that the water can’t “decide” which way to swirl. The swirl pattern is a topological defect—tiny \"frozen\" whirlpools that remain after a rapid phase transition. We ran computer experiments mimicking this super-fast cool-down in a one-dimensional strip. We found that the number of whirlpools is decided by a race: how quickly the strip is cooled versus how fast the material can adjust. If the quench is slow, the system has time to reach its preferred state and fewer defects survive; if it is rapid, many defects get locked in. The average distance between them equals the patch over which the local \"choice\" of the new state can still communicate before the transition finishes—essentially the distance that the order parameter can smooth out in the time left."

    "output": "Think of an atomic nucleus as a spinning droplet with an extra particle stuck to it. The simplest useful model for these lopsided, “odd” nuclei is the particle–rotor picture: the droplet’s spin and the particle’s motion should lock together like two gears. Yet for decades the gears slipped—physicists had to dial down the “Coriolis” twisting force by hand to match data.\n\nWe started from the basic shell model (nucleons in energy stair-steps) and allowed any mix of simple forces. Keeping only the familiar quadrupole and pairing pieces, we computed the low-energy bands of several deformed rare-earth nuclei. Results lined up well with experiment except for an exaggerated up-down zig-zag in certain states—the same old gear-slip.\n\nOur study shows the fix is not magic: just add one more magnetic force of fixed strength. With this single extra push the zig-zag smooths out, and a classic test nucleus also falls into line. The work shows that refining the forces, not tweaking fudge factors, gives a cleaner picture of how nuclei dance."

With it we show three surprising rules:  \n1) All dots on the same ring feel the same mass change.  \n2) They also share the same chance of falling apart.  \n3) The bubbles don’t scramble the colors of the original dots as long as two key knobs are set to zero.  \n\nWe tested the tool on charmonium—an atom-like object made of a heavy quark and its anti-quark—and found the mass shifts are big but almost identical for every low-lying state.  This could explain why earlier “dots-only” models still worked: their parameters had quietly absorbed the bubble effects.  Knowing this helps us tell what part of a particle’s mass and identity truly comes from the quarks themselves and what part is just temporary foam."

reversed reactions , which are very consistent , and ignoring any possible variation with energy , we find : @xmath10 in other words , _ close to the @xmath11 threshold , the timelike form factor of the proton is somewhat smaller than that of the neutron ! _    the fact that this ratio is less than unity requires confirmation , but even equal cross sections for @xmath12 and @xmath13 would be quite surprising , in view of the the conventional perturbative picture of baryon - antibaryon production in @xmath0 annihilation , as shown in fig . \n [ ee - fig ] . \n we recall that the ratio of the cross sections for the corresponding @xmath14-channel processes @xmath15 should be infinite at zero momentum transfer , where the form factor simply measures the total proton and neutron charges , corresponding to a coherent sum over the electromagnetic charges of their constituent quarks . \n it is also believed that the ratio ( [ exptalratio ] ) should be large at high momentum transfers . in a naive perturbative description of @xmath0 annihilation into baryons , the virtual time - like \n photon first makes a ` primary ' @xmath16 pair , which is then dressed by two additional quark - antiquark pairs that pop out of the vacuum . \n this dressing is thought to be a perturbative qcd process at high momentum transfers , which does not distinguish between the @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks , since gluon couplings are flavor - blind . \n thus , in this conventional perturbative picture , the only difference between the production rates of proton and neutron is through the different electric charges of the primary @xmath16 pairs . \n the total perturbative cross section is obtained by superposing the amplitudes with different primary @xmath16 pairs and squaring the result : @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the amplitude at @xmath21 for making the baryon @xmath22 with a given primary flavor @xmath23 , which is determined by the baryon wave functions . \n since the wave functions of the baryon octet have a mixed symmetry , the amplitudes @xmath20 tend to be highly asymmetric in specific models . \n for example , in the chernyak - zhitnitsky proton wave function  @xcite , the @xmath17 quark dominates , i.e. , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and similarly @xmath26 , @xmath27 . \n in such a limiting case we have @xmath28 while this is an extreme case , on general grounds we expect that the @xmath17 contribution dominates in the proton and the @xmath18 in the neutron , so that @xmath29 at large momentum transfers . \n we find it puzzling that the experimental ratio ( [ exptalratio ] ) is apparently below unity when @xmath30  gev@xmath31 , whereas the ratio should be much larger than unity at both larger ( timelike ) and smaller ( spacelike ) momentum transfers . clearly , the mechanism at work here is qualitatively different from those responsible for the above intuition . \n the lack of a conventional theoretical explanation is part of the motivation for the proposed new asymmetrical @xmath32 high - statistics collider at slac for the regime @xmath33 gev @xcite . \n this machine will yield high - precision data on baryon production in @xmath32 annihilation at threshold , providing a check on the fenice data and an accurate benchmark for testing possible theoretical explanations . \n the first thing one must realize is that even though @xmath34 , the process is highly nonperturbative . \n this is because the ` extra ' kinetic energy available to the quarks is very small . \n our approach @xcite to this puzzle is based on thinking about the time - reversed processes : @xmath35 . \n these may be viewed as two - step processes , with a coherent meson state serving as an intermediate state , as shown schematically in fig . \n [ pions1-fig ] . \n one possible motivation for this picture might be provided by the skyrme model  @xcite , according to which baryons appear as solitons in a purely bosonic chiral lagrangian . \n this model is formally justified as a low - energy approximation to large-@xmath36 qcd  @xcite , and is known to provide a good description of many low - energy properties of baryons : see  @xcite for reviews . \n skyrmion - anti - skyrmion annihilation provides  @xcite-@xcite a fairly accurate description of low - energy baryon - antibaryon annihilation . just after the skyrmion and anti - skyrmion touch \n , they ` unravel ' each other , and a coherent classical pion wave emerges as a burst that takes away energy and baryon number as quickly as causality permits . \n a specific parametrization of the initial pion configuration is  @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the profile of the chiral field , @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 is a range parameter , @xmath41 is chosen so that the total energy is that of the @xmath11 pair , and the form of @xmath38 guarantees that the pion configuration has zero net baryon number . \n this crude model has been shown  @xcite to reproduce satisfactorily the inclusive single - pion spectrum in @xmath42 annihilation at rest and the branching ratios for multi - pion final states . \n the details of this specific configuration are unimportant for our purposes : what is important is that the data are not inconsistent with such a model . \n indeed , although the skyrme model provides some motivation for our approach , it is not even essential for our purpose . \n what is important is that _ a single intermediate state should dominate _ the two - step @xmath35 process . \n this could , for example , equally well be a single intermediate @xmath43 resonant meson state .    to be more precise , \n since @xmath11 annihilation is a strong - interaction process , one must consider separately the @xmath44 and @xmath45 channels . \n accurately stated , our key assumption is that both of these channels are dominated by single states . \n these might be some excited @xmath46 and @xmath47 mesons , for example , just as well as coherent pion configurations ( [ amado ] ) with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    with this picture in mind \n , we write the @xmath48 @xmath35 annihilation amplitudes as @xmath49 , where the overall phase is irrelevant , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are relatively real , and @xmath52 is the relative phase between the @xmath44 and @xmath45 amplitudes . \n we then have @xmath53 it is apparent from ( [ ratio ] ) that @xmath54 if either @xmath55 or _ \n vice versa_.    remarkably , _ there is evidence from both @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilations that @xmath57 final states dominate by large factors_.    the clearest evidence comes from @xmath58 , where it is found by measuring final states with even and odd numbers of pions respectively that @xmath59 as seen in fig .  [ \n fig : pions ] .. the cross section in fig . \n [ fig : pions ] corresponds to the final state @xmath60 ; for the total @xmath61 one should multiply it by 1.5 @xcite . \n ] at these energies , we expect most final states created by @xmath62 to contain @xmath63 pairs , so that ( [ eeratio ] ) corresponds to the non-@xmath64 initial states we expect to dominate in @xmath11 annihilation \n . the value ( [ eeratio ] ) is similar to that found at lower energies , where @xmath65 , in agreement with naive quark models . \n the fact that the ratio @xmath66 continues to be large at higher energies is consistent with ideas of generalized vector meson dominance . \n the data from @xmath67 annihilations are less clear . \n theoretically , there are various calculations and other suggestions that the cross sections for @xmath67 annihilations into @xmath44 and @xmath45 may be similar . experimentally , several initial states contribute , including @xmath68s@xmath69 , @xmath70s / d@xmath71 and various p waves , but we are interested only in the @xmath43 @xmath70s / d@xmath71 initial states . \n it is in principle possible to distinguish different initial states by comparing annihilations in gas and liquid , as has been done in the analysis of ozi - violating final states , but we are unaware of a comparable analysis of multi - pion final states . because the initial state is a mixture with different @xmath72 , it is not possible to separate @xmath44 from @xmath45 simply by counting pions , as was the case in @xmath56 annihilation . \n the most convincing experimental information known to us comes from an analysis of @xmath73 . by comparing the rates for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , it has been possible to extract  @xcite @xmath76 which is comparable to the corresponding ratio ( [ eeratio ] ) in @xmath77 annihilation \n the fact that @xmath44 dominates over @xmath45 in the ratio ( [ nnbarratio ] ) is consistent with the hypothesis that most of the @xmath78 final states are created by @xmath79 and @xmath80 pairs in the initial @xmath67 state , with a @xmath64 pair popping out of the vacuum . \n the ratio ( [ nnbarratio ] ) would be small if primary @xmath64 pairs dominated . \n we now use the experimental information on the dominance by the @xmath44 channel in both @xmath56 ( [ eeratio ] ) and @xmath70s / d@xmath71 annihilation ( [ nnbarratio ] ) in a quantitative analysis of the @xmath81 production @xmath82 ratio ( [ ratio ] ) . defining @xmath83 , \n we can rewrite ( [ ratio ] ) as @xmath84 it is clear that the zero - momentum - transfer limit @xmath85 is obtained in the limit @xmath86 , and that the high - momentum - transfer limit @xmath87 is obtained in the limit @xmath88 . in order to estimate @xmath89 , our assumption of dominance in each isospin channel by a single state ( either a coherent multi - pion state ( [ amado ] ) or a generalized vector meson @xmath90 ) tells us that @xmath91 inserting the experimental indications ( [ eeratio],[nnbarratio ] ) into ( [ factorization ] ) , we estimate that @xmath92 the top end of this range seems to us quite conservative , whereas the lower end surely requires more justification from @xmath11 annihilation data . in the following numerical analysis \n , we keep @xmath93 general , but focus extra attention on the limits @xmath94 and @xmath95 . \n it is apparent from ( [ newratio ] ) that @xmath96 is possible for any value of @xmath93 , for a restricted range of the relative phase @xmath97 . \n however , the allowed range of @xmath52 is extended if @xmath93 is small . \n it is easy to see that @xmath82 lies in a narrow range @xmath98 around unity if @xmath52 falls within the following range : @xmath99 it is apparent that @xmath96 for all values of @xmath52 if @xmath93 is small , as suggested ( [ epsilon ] ) by the available data on @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilation . \n the quantitative behaviour of @xmath82 as a function of @xmath100 and @xmath101 is shown in fig . \n [ fig : threed ] . displayed explicitly is the region of the @xmath102 plane where @xmath82 falls within the experimental range ( [ exptalratio ] ) . \n we see that this range favours @xmath103 , whatever the value of @xmath93 . \n fig . \n [ fig : twod ] displays projections of fig . \n [ fig : threed ] for the two limiting values @xmath94 and @xmath95 . the allowed range ( [ exptalratio ] ) of @xmath82 and the corresponding ranges of @xmath52 \n are also shown . \n we conclude that the _ a priori _ puzzling large experimental value of the ratio @xmath104 can be understood qualitatively . \n this is relatively easy if the @xmath105 amplitude dominates over the @xmath45 amplitude , as suggested by the available data on @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilation and our assumption of dominance by a single coherent state in each isospin channel . \n the specific range ( [ exptalratio ] ) can be understood quantitatively if the @xmath44 and @xmath45 amplitude have a large relative phase @xmath52 . \n we are not in a position to judge the plausibility of such a large value of @xmath52 , from either an experimental or a theoretical point of view . \n it would be interesting to make tests of this possibility . \n the disagreement between the naive theoretical prediction and experiment is striking again . \n we comment finally on the surprisingly large value of the ratio @xmath106 observed by the cleo collaboration @xcite ( see also @xcite-@xcite for related experimental work ) .    as shown in fig . \n [ cleo - gg - fig ] , cleo find that close to threshold , which seems analogous to fenice result for the @xmath107 ratio .    as illustrated by fig . \n [ gg - fig ] , for a given quark flavor , the perturbative amplitude for baryon - antibaryon production in the photon - photon reaction scales like the quark charge squared , compared with the linear dependence of the amplitudes on the quark charge in the @xmath0 case discussed earlier . \n thus one might naively expect the ratio @xmath108 to be even smaller than the corresponding perturbative prediction for @xmath109 in @xmath0 \n .    it would be interesting to approach this puzzle from a point of view similar to that adopted in this paper . \n however , the situation in @xmath110 collisions is more complicated , because of the wider range of possible spin and isospin states . also , the information available on the isospin and spin decomposition is sparse compared with that in @xmath0 annihilation , which we used above . \n data for @xmath111 close to threshold might cast light on the @xmath112 puzzle , but are not yet available .    in ref . \n @xcite we have proposed a simple model that is able to accommodate the surprisingly large observed value of the ratio @xmath113 . \n our suggestion is based on a simple two - step approach , in which a single intermediate state with @xmath44 dominates over @xmath45 . \n this dominant intermediate state could be motivated by a skyrmion - anti - skyrmion picture , or could be some excited @xmath46 resonance . \n our model could be tested by further measurements of the ratios of different isospin amplitudes in @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilation , and suggests a relatively large phase difference between @xmath44 and @xmath45 amplitudes . \n we look forward to more experimental data bearing on these issues , for example from a new low - energy @xmath56 collider  @xcite .",

( ii ) raman scattering without conservation of the total angular momentum of manganese and the exciton in the intermediate state is possible . \n such transitions are allowed in presence of anisotropic exchange interaction between the exciton and the manganese @xmath17 electrons , i.e. if the symmetry of the system is reduced @xcite . \n the manganese polarization @xmath18 depends not only on the external magnetic field due to the thermal population of the zeeman sublevels , but also on the non - equilibrium electron polarization @xmath19 due to the dynamical polarization of mn spins by electrons ( holes are not oriented in bulk gaas @xcite ) . \n this process is similar to dynamical polarization of the nuclei in semiconductors ( overhauser effect ) and has been considered for ii - vi diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite . \n the dynamical polarization changes sign if the helicity of circular polarized excitation , @xmath20 or @xmath21 , is reversed . \n therefore , it is necessary to measure the two asymmetry parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the two polarizations . \n figure [ fig : sfrspectra](a ) shows sfrs spectra for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 excitation / detection polarizations in a magnetic field of 2  t. two pairs of lines corresponding to transitions where the angular momentum changes by @xmath26 are detected . \n their magnetic field dependence of the raman shift follows the expected linear dependence , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 [ see inset in fig . \n [ fig : sfrspectra](a ) ] , corresponding therefore to spin - flip transitions between the zeeman sublevels of the mn@xmath0 ions , i.e. the ionized manganese acceptors @xmath29 @xcite . \n the magnetic field dependence of the sas asymmetry parameter @xmath16 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 excitation and @xmath26 is shown in fig . \n [ fig : sfrspectra](b ) . \n the @xmath16 increase with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and they also depend on the helicity of laser excitation , from which we can conclude that optical orientation of manganese has been accomplished . using eq . \n ( [ eq : sfrsasymmetry ] ) we deduce the dependence of the manganese polarization @xmath12 on magnetic field for @xmath20 and @xmath21 excitation . \n the difference between the two polarizations allows us to estimate the contribution of the optical orientation to the manganese polarization @xmath32/2 \n \\approx -0.25 $ ] , independent of magnetic field for @xmath33  t [ see fig . \n [ fig : sfrspectra](c ) ] . \n the other contribution to @xmath12 , related to the thermal population of the zeeman sublevels @xmath34/2 $ ] , grows with field and is comparable with @xmath35 at @xmath36  t. the spin - flip resonance profile has a maximum at about 1.513  ev , which corresponds to resonant excitation of the exciton bound to the charged donor @xmath37 @xcite . \n moreover , the most intensive signals appear for pump density around 50  w/@xmath38 . \n the decrease of the spin - flip scattering intensity at higher pump densities is related with neutralization of ionized acceptors after capture of photoexcited holes @xcite . \n = 7.5 cm    the resulting mn@xmath0 polarization in longitudinal magnetic field is given by a dynamical equation analogous to the overhauser effect @xcite @xmath39 \\nonumber \\\\ -\\frac{1}{t_l}(p_m - p_t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term on the right side describes the dynamical polarization of manganese with time @xmath40 via electrons with polarization @xmath19 . \n the second term reflects the spin relaxation to the equilibrium value @xmath41 with time @xmath42 . here \n @xmath43 is the temperature and @xmath44 is the boltzmann constant . \n the equilibrium electron polarization @xmath45 is much smaller than @xmath46 since spin @xmath47 and lande factor @xmath48 of the electron are significantly smaller than those for mn@xmath0 . \n the steady state solution of eq . \n ( [ eq : ratemnpola ] ) neglecting @xmath49 gives @xmath50 here the first term corresponds to the equilibrium orientation resulting from thermalization on the zeeman sublevels ( i.e. @xmath51 ) , while the second term is the dynamical polarization @xmath35 by electrons . \n the electron polarization is determined by the laser helicity . \n a polarization @xmath52 was directly measured by optical orientation at the band edge under the same experimental conditions . \n therefore , eq .  ( [ eq : mnpola ] ) can be used for evaluating the time ratio @xmath53 and the actual temperature @xmath43 in the region of illumination . using the experimental value @xmath54 \n we obtain @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( for @xmath57  t ) . \n this corresponds to @xmath58  k , i.e. the real temperature under illumination is increased by 2 k. the same value for @xmath43 follows from the magnetic field dependence of @xmath59 when fitted with a brillouin function , see fig . \n [ fig : sfrspectra](c ) . \n electron spin - flip scattering with mn@xmath0 ions should also manifest itself in the dynamics of the average electron spin . indeed , since the mn polarization will be transferred back into the electron spin - system , the average electron spin should contain information about the mn polarization . in absence of other relaxation channels the dynamics of electron polarization is given by an expression similar to the @xmath40-term in eq . \n ( [ eq : ratemnpola ] ) @xmath60,\\ ] ] since it reflects the conservation of total spin in the flip - flop process . \n the electron spin relaxation time @xmath61 depends on the mn@xmath0 concentration @xmath62 and time @xmath40 through @xmath63 . for small photoelectron concentrations @xmath64 \n the electron spin relaxation time is much shorter than that of manganese , i.e. @xmath65 ( a similar relation holds for the electron - nuclear system ) . from trpl @xmath66  ns and , therefore \n , one can estimate @xmath67s for @xmath68  @xmath3 , and @xmath69  @xmath3 . under pulsed photoexcitation with repetition period @xmath70 ( which satisfies the condition @xmath71 ) , \n the manganese spin polarization is gradually accumulated and shows no change within time @xmath70 . \n therefore , in weak magnetic fields ( @xmath72 ) the solution of eq . \n ( [ eq : rateelectrpola ] ) in a time domain @xmath70 can be written as @xmath73 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_s}\\right).\\ ] ] at the moment of pulsed excitation @xmath74 the maximum possible electron polarization @xmath75 is generated @xcite . \n subsequently it decays with a characteristic time @xmath61 until it reaches the plateau , which corresponds to the steady state non - equilibrium manganese polarization . \n the plateau results from the spin back flow from manganese to the electrons , providing a long - lived electron spin memory . \n in previous trpl measurements in weak longitudinal magnetic fields we already observed a slow spin relaxation dynamics ( up to @xmath76s ) of electrons localized on shallow donors in gaas : mn @xcite . \n however , the small signal - to - noise ratio in these studies did not allow us to draw an unambiguous conclusion on the non - exponential spin evolution . \n large power densities induce undesired local heating . \n therefore , we increased the setup sensitivity by enlarging the illumination area by a factor of 400 , while keeping the pulse energy density low at @xmath77  nj/@xmath38 . \n the intensity transient of the donor - acceptor ( @xmath78 ) pl line is shown in fig .  [ \n fig : tprlplateau](a ) , showing a decay with 100  ns lifetime . \n the decay of circular polarization degree @xmath79 gives direct access to the spin dynamics of the oriented electrons . \n figure  [ fig : tprlplateau](b ) shows a nontrivial electron spin dynamics @xcite . \n we find an initial electron spin @xmath80 , which is close to the maximum value of 0.5 . \n after decay within several tens of ns the electron spin polarization reaches a plateau , whose level increases with magnetic field and reaches 0.35 for @xmath81  mt . \n using eq . \n ( [ eq : epola ] ) we determine the magnetic field dependencies of @xmath61 and @xmath12 , as presented in fig . \n [ fig : tprlplateau](c ) . \n the electron spin relaxation time increases from 20 to 100  ns in a magnetic field of 150  mt . the plateau values corresponding to @xmath12 are symmetric with respect to magnetic field inversion and they change sign if the excitation helicity sign is reversed ( i.e. , they follow the electron spin polarization ) . \n this corroborates our conclusion about optical orientation of manganese . \n the manganese orientation is absent in zero magnetic field , in accord with @xcite , however , it appears in weak magnetic fields and saturates for @xmath82  mt in line with the @xmath35 behavior from sfrs , see fig . \n [ fig : sfrspectra](c ) . \n we can exclude any influence of dynamical polarization of lattice nuclei since nuclear polarization should appear in much smaller magnetic fields @xmath83  mt , where @xmath84 is the local field onto a nucleus by the neighboring nuclei @xcite . moreover , we do not observe any plateau in p - gaas samples doped with non - magnetic ge acceptors @xcite . \n thus , the plateau evidences manganese dynamic polarization in weak longitudinal magnetic fields , which suppress mn@xmath0 spin relaxation . \n = 8.2 cm    above we discussed the spin transfer between the localized electrons and the mn@xmath0 ions . \n this transfer occurs due to fluctuations of the exchange interaction given by the hamiltonian @xmath85 . here \n @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the electron and manganese spin operators , respectively , and @xmath88 is a constant depending on the electron probability at the mn@xmath0 site . \n apart from the fluctuation term the exchange interaction in mean - field approximation contains an expression like @xmath89 , where the exchange constant @xmath90 is the average electron probability at the mn@xmath0 site and @xmath91 is the donor filling factor . \n the first term describes the interaction of the electron spin with the effective exchange field of manganese @xmath92 ( analogue of the overhauser field ) . \n the second term corresponds to interaction of manganese spins with the effective field of the electrons @xmath93 ( analogue of the knight field ) . for small excitation densities @xmath94 , and as a result @xmath95 . \n = 6 cm    the presence of the exchange manganese field can be detected via changes in the electron larmor precession frequency in an external magnetic field . since manganese polarization is absent in voigt geometry @xcite it is necessary to perform this experiment in oblique magnetic field for @xmath20 and @xmath21 polarized excitation . \n these data are summarized in fig . \n [ fig : obliqueb ] . figure  [ fig : obliqueb](a ) shows the oscillations of the circular polarization degree of the pl in time for the two opposite helicities ( @xmath96  mt applied at an angle @xmath97 with respect to the light propagation direction ) . \n indeed we see that the larmor frequencies @xmath98 corresponding to electron spin precession with @xmath48 are different ( @xmath99  ns@xmath100 ) . \n based on this difference we can plot the dependence of the effective magnetic field @xmath101 on external magnetic field @xmath31 , as shown in fig .  [ \n fig : obliqueb](b ) . \n the clear correlation between the magnetic field dependencies of @xmath102 and the plateau value @xmath103 indicates their common origin : both are proportional to the non - equilibrium manganese polarization @xmath12 . \n one can also estimate the exchange constant @xmath90 . \n we note that in oblique magnetic fields no oscillations with the mn@xmath0 @xmath104 factor are observed . \n this indicates that the manganese orientation is parallel to the direction of the external magnetic field @xmath105 , i.e. effective optical pumping occurs only for the spin component along @xmath105 . \n therefore , the polarization @xmath106 . then in the oblique geometry the field @xmath107 . simultaneously from eq . \n ( [ eq : epola ] ) we have for the plateau @xmath108 . the ratio of @xmath109 from fig . \n [ fig : obliqueb](b ) allows one to derive @xmath110ev . \n this is in agreement with the value of @xmath111ev for mn@xmath0 in the center of the donor , giving an upper limit for @xmath90 @xcite .    in conclusion \n , we have demonstrated optical orientation of mn@xmath0 acceptors in gaas using two optical techniques . \n dynamic manganese polarization is established in weak longitudinal magnetic fields ( @xmath1  mt ) , which are required to suppress the mn@xmath0 spin relaxation . \n the optically oriented mn@xmath0 ions maintain the spin and return part of the polarization back to the electron spin system providing a long - lived electron spin memory . \n the authors are grateful to k.  v.  kavokin for useful discussions . \n this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( grant no . \n 436rus@xmath1120 - 1 ) and the russian foundation for basic research .",

We studied how often this pair-production happens and what energies the new particles carry. We looked at two situations: both particles fly free, or the electron stays bound to one nucleus while the positron escapes. Because the nuclei are moving very slowly, the simplest “first-guess” calculation is almost zero; the next, more accurate step—accounting for the nuclear electric pull—becomes the main player. We also checked what changes when we remember that nuclei are heavy, not infinitely heavy. Surprisingly, at the slowest speeds these finite-mass tweaks can dwarf the usual textbook result. Knowing the odds and energies of these mini lightning bolts helps engineers design safer high-energy facilities and sharpens our picture of how matter can be created from pure electric fields."

    "output": "Physicists are racing to build tabletop versions of the universe’s forces inside clouds of ultracold atoms. Here’s the twist: the atoms play the role of particles obeying the rules of a simple lattice gauge theory—like a tiny Lego version of electromagnetism—while every speck of acne on the real face stays untouched. The team keeps every pore, spot, and blemish intact; no removal, no smoothing, no cover-up. The cold-atom setup stays authentic, a warts-and-all snapshot of how confinement and lattice artifacts emerge. The takeaway: even an unretouched lattice teaches us about the glue that binds matter, without cosmetic edits."

When we wind the clock backward, the sheet keeps the same uneven Kasner-like shape as long as both winds move slower than light.

    "output": "Imagine you have two long DNA strings made from the same beads, just cut in different places. The goal is to snip both strings into the same short pieces without wasting any beads. Finding the fewest possible cuts is called the “minimum common string partition” problem, and it’s famously tough—even for fast computers.\n\nWe wrote the first clear math recipe (an “integer linear program”) that tells a solver exactly how to make those cuts. For small or medium puzzles the recipe finds the perfect answer every time. For larger ones we added a quick two-step rule of thumb that still beats earlier tricks.\n\nBecause DNA is stored as long letter strings, better cutting plans can speed up comparison of genomes, helping biologists see how species differ or how genes move. Our new recipe and shortcut give the best answers known on every test we tried, and they open the door to faster, cheaper genetic studies."

We compared the spin speed the beats suggest to the spin speed found from the color of the X-ray glow; the two numbers don’t match.

    "output": "We counted the number of particles created when three kinds of “quarks”—the tiny bricks inside matter—are suddenly yanked apart at the LEP collider. Think of snapping a rubber band: heavy, medium, and light snaps all spray droplets, but we asked whether the spray pattern depends on the band’s thickness.\n\nAfter recording 11 million collisions we find the spray stays the same no matter how heavy the original band, agreeing with the basic QCD picture of how quarks turn into ordinary particles. This simple rule helps physicists trust one master recipe instead of juggling separate rules for every quark weight."

    "output": "Tiny see-through beads of silicon can act like miniature loudspeakers for light. When laser light of one color travels through them, they can sing back a new color—three times higher in pitch—without the energy losses that plague metal parts. We studied, on paper and on a computer, how the bead’s “magnetic heartbeat” (a special light-capturing dance called a magnetic dipole resonance) controls where this new color goes. By tweaking the bead’s shape, we can aim the color burst like turning a flashlight. This trick could help build ultra-small, cool-running devices that process light instead of electricity."

    "output": "Imagine a grid of tiny racetracks for light. Light can run clockwise or counter-clockwise inside each track; we treat these two directions like “spin up” and “spin down.” When the tracks are strongly linked, light hugs the outer lanes of the grid and always flows one way—like cars that can’t make U-turns. These one-way edge beams keep moving even when the track layout is a bit bumpy, so they’re ideal for guiding signals on a chip without back-reflection.\n\nCrucially, we don’t need to craft each link with special care; identical couplings that repeat with the grid are enough. Add equal amounts of tiny amplification and loss in opposite halves of the grid and the same edge beams become a built-in optical diode: light going right gets louder, light going left fades out. The device works at ordinary optical frequencies with standard silicon parts, offering a practical way to protect light signals from echoes and loss in future photonic circuits."

0 cylinder , and around 0.36 for the wider xc10 - 0 and xc12 - 0 cylinders . \n in addition , the height of this peak increases with the system width , as expected for a peak indicating a phase transition @xcite . \n on xc cylinders , we find that the svbc state has strong first- and second - neighbor correlations along diagonal directions , forming diagonally oriented ladders . thus , there are two degenerate diagonal svbc states on an xc cylinder , whereas for yc cylinders there is only the one vertical svbc pattern ( fig . \n 2 ) . for an infinite two - dimensional system , \n all three of these svbc ground states would be degenerate by rotational symmetry . in the classical limit , for large @xmath2 values \n , the ground state is a spin spiral state . however , quantum fluctuations are strong enough to melt the spiral order and form the svbc , in agreement with ref . \n @xcite .    in the rest of this letter , we focus specifically on @xmath17 inside the intermediate phase @xcite . to measure magnetic correlations , we apply `` pinning '' magnetic fields at one end of the cylinder and measure the resulting magnetization pattern . unlike in the af phase \n , the induced magnetization decays exponentially from the end of the cylinder with a decay length of 2 to 3 lattice spacings for various cylinders . \n we further check the response to a local magnetic field applied to a spin at the cylinder center . \n this local magnetic field response is quite short ranged . \n it only influences its nearby surrounding sites , as opposed to generating a large region of staggered magnetization in the af phase .     on ( a ) yc7 - 3 , ( b ) xc9 - 1 and ( c ) xc12 - 0 cylinders . \n the widths of the lines are proportional to @xmath32 for all the plots , with solid blue(dashed red ) lines for negative(positive ) values . \n the bond strength scale is indicated at the top . \n the three different sublattices of plaquettes are labeled as a , b , c. in these figures , we keep @xmath33 states in our dmrg calculation . the truncation error for xc9 - 1 is smaller than @xmath34 , while it is near @xmath35 for the wider yc7 - 3 and xc12 - 0 cylinders.,width=321 ]    references @xcite suggest that the intermediate phase is a pvb phase with long - range dimer - dimer correlations . \n to investigate pvb ordering we study cylinders with periodic boundary conditions that are compatible with pvb order , including yc4 - 0 , yc6 - 0 , yc7 - 3 , yc8 - 0 , xc6 - 0 , xc9 - 1 and xc12 - 0 @xcite . \n we pin the pvb pattern at the cylinder ends by the choice of which spins are kept and how long the cylinder is ( see fig . \n [ pvb ] ) . \n we define a local pvb order parameter at each site using the nearest - neighbor spin correlations on the three adjacent plaquettes . \n the plaquettes form three sublattices in the pvb phase , as labeled in figs . \n [ pvb](a ) and [ pvb](b ) , and one plaquette from each sublattice is adjacent to each site . \n let @xmath36 be the sum over the six bonds around plaquette a. then , we define the local pvb order parameter as @xmath37 near the ends of the cylinders , this order parameter is nonzero , and in general it is a complex number . \n we extrapolate this local order parameter versus the truncation error to estimate its values in the limit of large bond dimension @xmath38 . for long cylinders \n , its magnitude decays exponentially with distance from the end , with a correlation length @xmath39 that depends on the cylinder , as shown in the inset of fig . \n [ pdecay ] . \n these pvb correlations can be slightly incommensurate , particularly for the narrower yc cylinders . for the xc9 - 1 cylinder with a shifted connection \n , we measure the distance from the end along the direction perpendicular to the wrapping vector to obtain the shortest pvb correlation length @xmath39 .     for different cylinder circumferences @xmath40 at @xmath17 . \n the black circles indicate yc cylinders , while the red diamonds indicate xc cylinders . \n the straight green line illustrates the expected linear behavior at the quantum critical point of the two - dimensional system . \n the inset shows the local pvb order parameter versus distance from the end of the cylinder in lattice spacings . \n the estimated pvb correlation length @xmath39 is indicated for each cylinder.,width=264 ]    the pvb correlation length @xmath39 versus cylinder circumference @xmath40 is shown in fig . \n [ pdecay ] . \n this figure includes cylinders with all orientations , and we see that for our larger circumferences , the xc cylinders appear to have a longer pvb correlation length than the yc cylinders . if the 2d system is at a quantum critical point , the correlation length is expected to be proportional to the circumference by standard finite - size scaling . \n it appears that the correlation length actually increases faster than the circumference , suggesting that this system may have weak pvb long - range order in the 2d limit of infinite circumference .    in conclusion \n , we have studied the @xmath0 honeycomb @xmath41 heisenberg model on various cylinders extensively using dmrg . \n we find that the ground state displays a paramagnetic phase for @xmath16 . by studying pvb order on various cylinders , we find that the pvb correlation length grows at least linearly with the cylinder circumference . \n this suggests that in this phase the system is either quantum critical or has weak long - range pvb order . \n these results are compatible with an early theoretical study that a direct phase transition between an af and a pvb state is possible on the honeycomb lattice @xcite . \n we thank hong -

The agreement confirms a 50-year-old idea: when low-temperature gas meets a vortex, heat can be turned around almost perfectly.  \n\nWhy care? Understanding this ultra-efficient “mirror” for heat helps physicists design better sensors that operate barely above absolute zero and sharpens our picture of how energy travels in the coldest places in the universe."

Thick lanes of dust usually hide its downtown, but a new set of sharper “heat-vision” photos lets us see straight into the bright, peanut-shaped bulge at the center. Instead of a simple ball of stars, the bulge stretches farther the farther out you look, and its long axis sits slightly crooked compared with the galaxy’s main disk. Computer matches show this peanut shape is the vertical “skeleton” of a bar—a straight river of stars that funnels gas inward. Beyond the peanut zone, the photos pick up a thinner spine of light that keeps going along the same tilt, confirming Andromeda has a bar like the one in our Milky Way. Because the pictures look the same in all near-infrared colors, the stars inside must be well mixed. Knowing Andromeda’s true bar-and-bulge layout helps astronomers test how such inner structures steer star birth and shape galaxies over time."

    "output": "Imagine the proton as a tiny guitar string. When you pluck it, the first note that rings out is called the Roper resonance. We have now measured exactly where that note sits: 1 440 MeV, or about 1.5 times the mass of the proton itself. By sending low-energy photons into hydrogen targets at Mainz and Bonn, we watched the string vibrate and recorded every overtone. The data show only one clean pitch, not two blurred together. That single note decays mainly into two pions, a pattern expected from a first radial excitation. Because the resonance is over-constrained, we can rule out the idea that two separate states hide under the same peak. This clears up a long-standing puzzle in baryon spectroscopy and tells us the Roper is simply the proton’s first radial excitation, not a more exotic object."

One map (BMP) is supposed to be the upgraded version, yet for some collisions it predicts outcomes 1,000 times bigger than the older map (MR). Oddly, the old map still matches the lab data. The mismatch hints the new map may be too “lumpy” where the molecules meet. For gentler bumps, the two maps mostly agree within a factor of two.

can quantum effects improve the performance of a heat engine , and if so , can we use quantum correlations as a fuel  @xcite ? \n while a lot of work in this field is focused on heat engines , we consider here another standard example of a heat machine : the absorption refrigerator . \n the first such device was invented in 1850 by the carr brothers  @xcite and was one of the first practical refrigerators used in industry . \n modern designs incorporating numerous technical improvements  @xcite remain a popular choice of refrigeration devices  @xcite . in general ( fig . \n [ fig : heat_flow ] ) , an absorption refrigerator consists of three parts : cold , hot and work bodies . \n it makes use of heat from the work body to cool down the cold one , while transferring heat to the hot body . \n although the classical thermodynamics of the absorption refrigerator is well understood  @xcite , its description in terms of quantum mechanics is still a subject of numerous theoretical studies  @xcite , and several proposals to implement it in the quantum regime using a system of superconducting qubits  @xcite or quantum dots  @xcite exist in the literature .     * \n experimental setup . \n a*. schematic of the linear rf - paul trap with three trapped @xmath0yb@xmath1 ions . \n the raman beams ( r1 , r2 , and r3 ) are responsible for applying the optical dipole force for the state preparation , and for coupling the ions motional modes to the internal state during the motional state detection . \n two ( grey ) ions are prepared in the @xmath2  dark \" state ( see methods ) . \n the radial confinement of the ions provided by radiofrequency ( rf ) potential , can be fine tuned by adjusting the offset voltage applied to the diagonally opposite trap electrodes . \n the speed of this tuning is controlled by a pair of low - pass filters ( lpfs ) . \n * b , * direction of heat flow in the absorption refrigerator . \n energy from the work body is transferred to the hot body , which pumps energy from cold body to hot body . \n the black arrows label the motional eigenmodes utilized as heat bodies ]    here we study the performance of absorption refrigeration in the quantum regime , utilizing the modes of motion of trapped ytterbium ions as the heat bodies ( fig . \n [ fig : heat_flow ] ) . \n we experimentally test two hypotheses : whether the absorption refrigerator performs better when the thermal state of the work mode is squeezed  @xcite , and whether there is an advantage when operating in the single - shot cooling regime  @xcite . \n the latter relies on coherent population oscillations that can occur among the coupled modes in the quantum system before the steady state is reached . \n the interaction hamiltonian in the system of three ions , induced by anharmonicity of the coulomb repulsion between the ions , has the form  @xcite @xmath3 where the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are the annihilation ( creation ) operators for the corresponding harmonic oscillators labeled by @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the coupling rate . here @xmath8 is the equilibrium distance between the ions , @xmath9 is the ion mass , @xmath10 is the ion charge , @xmath11 is the vacuum permittivity , and @xmath12 is the single ion axial trap frequency . the hamiltonian   is valid in the rotating wave approximation when the mode frequencies satisfy the resonance condition @xmath13 .    to understand how this absorption refrigerator works  @xcite , \n consider the following scenario : when the temperature of the work ( @xmath14 ) mode is higher than the hot ( @xmath15 ) mode , some energy tends to flow from the former to the latter . \n due to the structure of the interaction hamiltonian  , transfer of energy from ( @xmath14 ) to ( @xmath15 ) is always accompanied by energy transfer from ( @xmath16 ) to ( @xmath15 ) resulting in the cooling of the cold ( @xmath16 ) mode . at some temperatures \n this process is balanced by the flow of the energy in opposite direction , leading to an equilibrium . for thermal states \n , it then requires the mean phonon numbers @xmath17 to fulfill ( see methods ) @xmath18 if the system is initially prepared at @xmath19 away from equilibrium , the interaction hamiltonian   can only lead to mean phonon numbers @xmath20 such that @xmath21 . to demonstrate the equilibrium performance of the refrigerator , we start with all modes prepared in thermal states ( see methods ) . \n we fix @xmath22 in the hot mode and change @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for each value of @xmath23 and @xmath24 \n we measure the mean phonon numbers of the hot mode at long interaction times @xmath25 at which they have effectively converged to their long - time average values ( see fig .

[ \n fig : cooling_cold_mode](a - f ) . \n for @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,    we observe a nett decrease of the cold mode mean phonon number in panels ( a , b ) , equilibrium in ( c ) , and an increase in ( d - f ) . \n the data points are plotted relative to the computed long - time averages and show good agreement with theory . \n the nett difference of the final steady state from the initial mean phonon number is shown in fig . \n [ fig : cooling_cold_mode]g . again the long - time average values predicted by quantum theory match the experiment quite well , while prediction of equation   disagrees with the data . \n we next study the influence of quantum mechanical coherence . \n we prepare a squeezed thermal state of the work mode  @xcite and compare cooling performance to the case where the mode is prepared in a thermal state of the same mean phonon number . squeezing increases the mean phonon number from @xmath23 to @xmath39cosh@xmath40  sinh@xmath41 , with @xmath42 the squeezing parameter  @xcite . \n the experiment is repeated for several values of @xmath42 , keeping @xmath23 fixed . \n when @xmath42 increases ( fig . \n [ fig : cooling_cold_mode](h - k )    ) , the system undergoes a transition from heating to cooling , as can be seen from the evolution of the cold mode . \n we plot the difference of final and initial mean phonon numbers in panel ( l ) for direct comparison to the previously discussed thermal case in ( g ) . \n the nett change in the mean phonon number is now smaller , which implies that squeezing of the work mode decreases the cooling performance . \n further simulations show that , for a fixed @xmath23 , cooling is indeed most effective when no squeezing is applied at all . \n * absorption refrigerator operating in the single shot regime . \n * the difference @xmath43 between the measured initial phonon number and the mean phonon number at interaction time @xmath44 that gives the strongest cooling ( colored points ) , is shown for several @xmath23 . \n the blue shaded region corresponds to the range of predicted by   after taking the experimental uncertainty of @xmath45 into account and the green shaded region is the long time average predicted by numerical simulations . \n the uncertainty in the x - axis is the error of the fit to the measured initial work population , while the uncertainty in the y - axis represents one standard deviation of the statistical uncertainty . ] \n we now focus on the single - shot cooling method  @xcite . here \n the interaction is switched off at the right moment such that the evolution halts at a transient state with a lower mean phonon number @xmath46 than the steady state one @xmath47 . \n conversely , one would achieve a higher mean phonon number than the steady - state value in the heating regime . \n both regimes can be seen in fig . \n [ fig : cooling_cold_mode](a - f ) , where the greatest deviation of @xmath46 from the initial @xmath24 is consistently reached at about @xmath48s of interaction time , @xmath49 . \n we plot in fig . \n [ fig : eq_violation ] the difference between the initial and this value for different work mode phonon numbers @xmath23 . \n the first data point at @xmath50 has a vanishing difference since it corresponds to the system at thermal equilibrium according to \n . however , the difference increases with growing @xmath23 , and exceeds the long - time steady - state value consistently and significantly  a striking demonstration of the advantage of coherence - assisted single - shot cooling  @xcite . \n note that the cooling even exceeds the thermal equilibrium values set by  , which could be viewed as a classical thermodynamics benchmark . \n the ability to cool more efficiently and on a shorter timescale is related to the transient coherence generated during the unitary time evolution under the trilinear hamiltonian  . \n indeed , it is easily shown that an incoherent version of the trilinear interaction ( see methods ) precludes the device from cooling further than the steady - state occupation  @xcite . in conclusion , we have demonstrated an implementation of an absorption refrigerator utilizing the harmonic modes of motion in a trapped - ion system . \n we have shown that the classical concept of the absorption refrigerator can be extended to the quantum domain , and its cooling power per unit mass ( @xmath51 2.4 w / kg ) is comparable to its classical counterparts.19 w / kg . ] \n the experiment confirms our theoretical understanding of the refrigerator dynamics and its steady - state characteristics based on a coherent three - body interaction model . in particular , we could observe that , starting away from equilibrium , the system energies rapidly approach a steady state , even in the absence of environmental coupling . \n simple arguments based on equilibrium thermodynamics do not predict this steady state , although they give the correct temperature requirements for cooling . while it was shown that utilizing squeezed states allows the refrigerator to transition from a heating to cooling regime , hence demonstrating that squeezing could be used as a quantum fuel , when directly compared to the thermal work reservoir we could also observe a diminished performance of the refrigerator . \n this leads to the surprising implication that exploiting quantum resources does not necessarily enhance , but may even be detrimental to the performance of heat machines \n an issue worth studying further . on the other hand , \n we demonstrate a significant advantage with respect to both steady - state cooling and thermodynamic benchmark when we operate the refrigerator in a single - shot regime .",
    "output": "Imagine three tiny charged beads, each vibrating like a miniature spring. Physics says you can’t normally make one spring cool another without outside help. We built exactly that impossible trick.\n\nWe trapped three ytterbium ions and linked their spring-like vibrations so heat from one vibration pumps energy into another, leaving the third noticeably colder. By watching the beads cool below both classical predictions and long-time averages, we confirmed a genuine quantum absorption refrigerator.\n\nWe also checked whether “squeezing” the hot spring (a quantum trick that sharpens position while widening momentum) helps. Surprisingly, squeezing actually weakens cooling compared with a plain thermal spring.\n\nFinally, we stopped the motion at just the right instant—before the system settles. This single-shot timing cools the target spring faster and lower than any steady-state method, hinting that short-lived quantum links, not permanent temperature, drive the advantage."

    "output": "Imagine a tiny “leaky” box that can trap a quantum particle.  \nOrdinary quantum rules say the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must stay fixed at 100 %.  \nWhen the box itself absorbs or emits particles, that total slips away, so the usual rules break down.  \n\nWe show that the only way to restore a constant, 100 % probability is to change the ruler that measures distances: the ruler must stretch or shrink even far from the box.  \nThis stretching is not a familiar local change; it is a non-local twist of space itself.  \nRemarkably, systems far outside the box—like distant atoms—feel no change; only the particle inside the leaky box is affected.  \n\nOur work reveals why some tiny, engineered traps in quantum labs seem to “lose” probability, and how a simple, universal yardstick can fix the accounting without touching anything else in the lab."

    "output": "Imagine the skin of a tiny bubble: it’s made of oily molecules (lipids) that can spontaneously sort into “oil-and-vinegar” patches when conditions change.  \nWe studied a bubble whose two sides touch salty water of different saltiness and whose outer coat carries some extra negative charge.  Because the two sides talk to each other through electric pushes and pulls, changing the salt level on one side can make the patches form sooner and grow larger.  Using a simple energy-budget picture, we mapped when these patches appear and found that stronger “electric glue” between the sides or a bigger salt difference raises the temperature at which the bubble’s skin starts to separate.  Under strong saltiness the skin can even split into three distinct patches at once.  \n\nWhy care?  Cells use the same patchy sorting to cluster sensors, shuttle cargo, and send signals; knowing the electric rules that drive the patchwork could help design better drug-delivery bubbles or understand how cells react when their surroundings change."

Each crossing acts like a hidden speed bump, making atom-trio collisions suddenly speed up or slow down. These sharp jumps are easy flags for experimenters to spot.  \n\nWhy care? Spotting the flags proves the tetramer is real and gives a new dial—temperature and magnetic field—to control how atoms stick or bounce.

39/t422    introduction    although a great many innovative and exciting suggestions were made for physics investigations following the proposed 12 gev upgrade , it was eventually necessary to focus on two main themes . \n we deal with these in turn below . \n the first is the possibility of unambiguously determining the valence @xmath0 and @xmath1 quark distributions of the free nucleon in the region of bjorken @xmath2 above 0.4 ( and as close as possible to 1 ) . in particular , while the valence @xmath0 distribution is relatively well known , it has recently been realized that the @xmath1 distribution is very poorly determined in this region  at least if one requires that the determination should be demonstrably model independent . for the polarized valence distributions , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , \n the situation is even worse , with no measurements at all for @xmath2 above 0.5 . \n experiments with @xmath5he and @xmath5h targets , following the 12 gev upgrade , could resolve the longstanding problem concerning the valence @xmath1 distribution for @xmath2 up to 0.85  establishing finally whether or not the predictions of perturbative qcd are correct . \n as a by - product one would complete our knowledge of the emc effect over the full range of nuclear mass number . \n using polarized proton and @xmath5he targets one could also complete the determination of the polarized distributions @xmath3 and @xmath4 over the same region of @xmath2 . \n the result of this program would be a definitive picture of the valence structure of the nucleon , including its spin dependence . \n measurements using polarized proton and @xmath5he targets at the 12 gev facility would also allow one to definitively establish the twist-3 component of the structure functions @xmath6 and @xmath7  at least for low moments . \n this major advance would be made possible by a factor of 10 improvement in statistics over what has hitherto been possible and over a much greater range of bjorken @xmath2 : @xmath8 . from the theoretical point of view the twist-3 structure function \n provides totally novel information on the internal structure of the nucleon \n information that should be accessible to lattice qcd within the same ten year time frame .    at a \n later and more mature stage of development of the facility other exciting possibilities arise . \n one could use the knowledge of @xmath9 and @xmath4 , at relatively large @xmath2 , to test the validity of duality in this region and if it works to use it to obtain insight into these distributions for @xmath2 as large as 0.95 . \n we could also use this knowledge to test the utility of semi - inclusive measurements for determining spin and flavor dependence of parton distributions . \n if these tests are successful one could apply these methods to an accurate determination of the spin and flavor dependence of the nucleon sea in the region @xmath10 . \n finally , one could use a tensor polarized deuteron target to probe completely new structure functions such as @xmath11 for @xmath2 near and beyond 1 . \n large-@xmath2 valence distributions[sec : valence ]    the distribution of the valence quarks in the nucleon is one of its most fundamental properties . because of the relative 4:1 weighting for electromagnetic probes , the proton structure function primarily constrains the @xmath0 distribution in the proton . to determine the @xmath1 distribution requires a second measurement , traditionally using the deuteron . while the approximate treatment of the deuteron as a neutron and a proton at rest , so that @xmath12 , is not too bad for @xmath2 below ( say ) 0.4 , it breaks down badly at large @xmath2 \n nevertheless it is only in the past few years that it has been realized that a realistic treatment of the effects of fermi motion and binding in the deuteron lead to an extracted neutron structure function which is quite different from that used in all standard parametrizations of parton distributions . \n in particular , a reanalysis of slac data by melnitchouk and thomas @xcite suggested that the @xmath13 ratio may actually approach the pqcd prediction of @xmath14 @xcite , rather than 0 as @xmath15 .    while this analysis is persuasive @xcite , our knowledge of such fundamental properties should not be model dependent . \n fig . \n 1 shows the present , appalling state of our knowledge of @xmath13 at large @xmath2 . \n it is clearly vital to find a facility and a technique that allow us to map out the valence distributions in a model independent manner over the complete @xmath2 range and this problem was addressed by a number of participants at the workshop including bosted , forest , klein , leader , melnitchouk , meziani , olness , petratos and scopetta . \n it is in this context that the idea of using @xmath5he and @xmath5h targets is extremely exciting . \n the fundamental point is that charge symmetry is a very good symmetry for strongly interacting systems and these two mirror nuclei are related by charge symmetry . in the limit of exact charge symmetry \n the distribution of protons ( the neutron ) in @xmath5he would be the same as that of neutrons ( the proton ) in @xmath5h  regardless of the size of the emc effect in these nuclei ! \n a measurement of the structure functions of these two nuclei would then allow us to determine @xmath16 exactly . \n in practice there are electromagnetic corrections to be made and charge symmetry is slightly broken by the strong interaction . \n nevertheless , exact faddeev calculations of the structure of the a=3 nuclei allow us to estimate these corrections quite accurately  and to test the dependence of the nuclear structure functions on the two - nucleon potential used . in order to understand the analysis to be applied to the data we need to define the ratios : ( r^3he ) = f_2^^3he 2 f_2^p + f_2^n ; r(^3h ) = f_2^^3h f_2^p + 2 f_2^n , [ eq:1 ] and the super - ratio : = r(^3he ) r(^3h ) . \n [ eq:2 ] inverting these expressions directly yields the ratio of the free neutron to proton structure functions : @xmath17 we stress that @xmath18 extracted via eq.([eq:3 ] ) does not depend on the size of the emc effect in @xmath5he or @xmath5h , but rather on the _ ratio _ of the emc effects in @xmath5he and @xmath5h . \n if the neutron and proton distributions in the @xmath19 nuclei are not dramatically different , one might expect the super - ratio , @xmath20 to be approximately one . to test whether this is \n indeed the case requires an explicit calculation of the emc effect in the @xmath19 system . \n the super - ratio @xmath20 , calculated by afnan et al . \n @xcite , is shown in fig .  2 for the various nuclear model wave functions ( pest , rsc and yamaguchi ) , using the cteq parameterization @xcite of parton distributions at @xmath21  gev@xmath22 . \n the emc effects are seen to largely cancel over a large range of @xmath2 , out to @xmath23 , with the deviation from the central value , @xmath24 , lying within @xmath25 . \n furthermore , the dependence on the nuclear wave function is very weak . \n in addition to the dependence on the two - body force used one also needs to test the sensitivity of @xmath20 to the assumed nucleon structure functions . \n the detailed study may be found in ref.@xcite . for our purposes \n it is enough to say that while there is some sensitivity one can adopt a straightforward iterative procedure which is quite rapidly convergent , so that starting from standard distributions , like cteq , one can quickly converge to a self - consistent set of structure functions and @xmath20 . \n the corollary to this is that having determined @xmath26 and @xmath20 , one will not only pin down @xmath27 but will also determine the emc effect in @xmath5he and @xmath5h , as well as the deuteron , thus completing our experimental knowledge of the nuclear emc effect @xcite . \n this will be a vital assistance in sorting out the origin of this famous effect @xcite , especially the possible change of nucleon structure in a nuclear medium , which is fundamental to our understanding of qcd itself . \n spin dependent valence distributions    as noted earlier , the case for the determination of the spin dependent structure functions in the region @xmath28 is even clearer  there is no data in this region at all ! \n one does not even know , for example , whether the neutron spin structure function , @xmath29 , becomes positive in this region ! \n this was highlighted , for example , in the presentation of leader who made important connections to `` old fashioned '' analysing power data ( @xmath30 ) @xcite . \n it is remarkable that the focus on the `` spin crisis '' has diverted so much effort to small @xmath2 that nothing is known in the large @xmath2 region . while there is room for more work , especially on exchange current corrections ( mesons , @xmath31 s , etc . ) \n , it seems that one can determine @xmath29 relatively well from measurements with a polarized @xmath5he target @xcite , while accurate data on the proton may be simplified by the development of a better @xmath32 target . \n it is clear that jefferson lab , with the 12 gev upgrade , can provide a definitive picture of the spin dependent valence structure functions in the large @xmath2 region , thus completing one of the fundamental tasks of the international program in deep inelastic scattering . on the theoretical side , \n apart from the comparison with qcd inspired models @xcite , one can expect these distributions to be accessible to lattice qcd over the same time frame @xcite . \n twist-3 structure functions    a compelling case was presented by ji , bosted , averett , meziani and others that following the proposed upgrade , jefferson lab could determine @xmath33 for both the proton and neutron , with an order of magnitude improvement in statistical accuracy in the range @xmath34 . \n this would enable one to remove the trivial twist-2 contribution and unambiguously isolate the twist-3 piece . \n as this involves _ totally novel _ \n information on the internal structure of the target , it should provide extremely important new information on the internal structure of hadrons @xcite . \n for example , the second moment of the twist-3 part of @xmath33 , @xmath35 , involves the matrix elements @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the color magnetic field inside the hadron . this will be the first indication of the correlation of the quark and gluon fields inside a hadron . \n conclusion    the consensus of the participants at this workshop were that , following an upgrade to 12 gev , jefferson lab would be able to provide important and definitive answers to our questions concerning the spin and flavor distributions of the valence quarks in the nucleon . \n it would also be able to provide the first unambiguous information on the twist-3 structure functions of the nucleon , that is the correlations between quarks and gluons in the proton . \n this represents an outstanding physics program .    as a side benefit of the determination of the valence @xmath1 distribution we would also have accurate measurements of the emc effect in @xmath5he , @xmath5h and the deuteron for the first time , thus allowing a complete study of the nuclear emc effect and the possible change of nucleon structure in medium .    following these top priority investigations \n there are numerous other important studies to be made . \n it is vital to explore the validity of bloom gilman scaling @xcite for spin structure functions @xcite . \n as we have already seen from jefferson lab data , scaling may well work where one has no theoretical reason to justify it ( yet ) . \n if it can be shown to work one could use the technique to study a host of quantities at large @xmath2 , notably @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , etc . as explained in detail by mulders , leader and ent @xcite , \n semi - inclusive measurements allow us probe a large number of new observables . \n as emphasised by mitchell , one can also use a tensor polarized target to determine the new spin structure function @xmath11 , which is expected to be significant at large @xmath2 . \n one could investigate the spin dependence of the emc effect at large @xmath2 @xcite using @xmath42 and @xmath43 targets . \n as emphasised by brodsky and liuti , one can investigate quark and gluon correlations in the nucleon by measuring higher twist structure functions . \n as discussed by kumar , parity violation can also be exploited to study parton distributions .    in summary , there is an urgent physics case for the 12 gev upgrade in order to answer vital and topical questions which go to the heart of our understanding of strongly interacting systems .",
    "output": "Imagine the proton as a tiny city made of three kinds of Lego bricks: red, green, and blue.  \nWe already know where most red bricks sit, but we have almost no map for the green ones, and zero map for how those bricks are spinning.  \nJefferson Lab’s planned 12 GeV upgrade will give us the first clear pictures of both the missing green bricks and their spins, using special helium-3 and hydrogen-3 targets that cancel nuclear distortions.  \nIn short: sharper maps of the bricks tell us how the whole city holds together and help complete the rule-book for why matter is stable."

partcile excitons or trions have also been reported recently in two - dimensional materials such as mos@xmath1 @xcite and have attracted much attention as a test - bed for studying many - body interactions in a semiconductor with both spin and valley degrees of freedom . \n previous theoretical studies in bulk d@xmath0x in silicon have been performed from effective mass approximations to understand auger recombination in donors @xcite and more recently to investigate applications such as quantum hall charge sensors @xcite . \n this work presents atomistic electronic structure calculations of the d@xmath0x in a device environment for the first time , crucial for experiments to integrate optical addressing methods in a silicon quantum computer . \n a neutral p donor in bulk silicon comprises a positively charged donor core that produces a coulomb potential and binds an electron 45 mev below the conduction band edge ( also called the d@xmath0 state ) . \n if stimulated by a laser pulse of appropriate wavelength , an additional electron and a hole can be generated and bound to the impurity , forming the donor bound exciton ( d@xmath0x ) , as shown in fig . \n 1a ) for a bulk donor , with blue and red representing the electron and hole wavefunction probability densities respectively . \n the bulk transition energy from a d@xmath0 to a d@xmath0x state has been measured to be near 1150 mev @xcite . \n fig . \n 1b ) shows a schematic of the same system under an applied electric field . \n both the d@xmath0 and the d@xmath0x undergo a stark shift , however the latter is more strongly perturbed due to the larger size of the wavefunction . \n the electric field pushes the electrons and holes in opposite directions and thus changes the excitation wavelength from @xmath2 to @xmath3 . \n fig . \n 1c ) shows the combined effect of an interface and an electric field with excitation wavelength @xmath4 . in this case , the donor wave functions are also truncated by the interface . \n later , we will show the transition energies , hartree energy , wavefunctions and transition dipole moments for these three cases , as well as the interface and e - field induced hyperfine and hole splitting that can affect the spin - resolved transition energies . \n = 3.4 in    [ fi2 ]    in fig . \n 2 , a schematic of the energy levels of the d@xmath0 and d@xmath0x are shown for a bulk - like exciton and an exciton in a nanoscale device . in the d@xmath0 state , \n the hyperfine interaction between the nuclear and the electronic spins produces a singlet and a triplet splitting @xmath5 . \n the d@xmath0x has two electrons spin paired in a singlet with @xmath6 , and as a result , the spin splitting in a b - field is governed by the hole 3/2 and 1/2 total angular momentum states , which arise from the heavy hole ( hh ) and the light hole ( lh ) bands . \n if the donor is located close to an interface or subjected to an electrical field , then the transition energies of the d@xmath0x are strongly modified , as shown in fig . \n 2b ) . \n first , the presence of an interface or electric field changes the localization of all the confined particles in both d@xmath0 and d@xmath0x . as the wave functions shift and deform in space , the particle - particle interactions also change . \n we have computed this transition energy from self - consistent hartree method with tight - binding , and denote it as @xmath7 . \n second , the electric field or the interface also splits the 3/2 and 1/2 states of the hole bound to the d@xmath0x , which we denote as @xmath8 . \n this splitting is due to the effect of confinement on the hh and lh bands , which have different effective masses . \n third , the hyperfine coupling of the d@xmath0 state also changes due to the field and depth @xcite , and is denoted as @xmath9 in fig . \n 2b ) . \n details of how the spin - resolved d@xmath0x transitions can be used to initialize and readout the donor nuclear spins using an auger recombination process can be found in refs @xcite . \n = 3.4 in    [ fi3 ]    we employ an sp@xmath10d@xmath11s * atomic orbital tight - binding method with spin - orbit interaction and nearest neighbor coupling to represent the full band structure of silicon @xcite . \n more details of the methods can be found in the supplementary materials . \n first , we investigate the stark effect of the d@xmath0x when the donor is in bulk silicon . \n fig . \n 3 shows the coulomb energy , transition energy and transition dipole moment of the three - particle d@xmath0x for a bulk - like case as a function of an electric field . in the simulation , a bulk system is represented by a 30 nm @xmath12 30 nm @xmath12 30 nm of silicon lattice bounded by hydrogen passivated hard - walls on all sides . \n the donor is placed at the center of the box , and the simulation domain size is chosen such that the electronic and hole wavefunctions at zero e - field are not affected by the boundaries of the box . \n this is reasonable as the bohr radii of the d@xmath0 and d@xmath13 states are in the range of 1 - 4 nm . \n the coulomb energy of the d@xmath0x comprises of the repulsive energy between the two electrons and the attractive energy between the hole and each of the electrons . \n fig . \n 3a ) shows this three - particle coulomb energy with an e - field , computed from eq 3 of the supplementary materials ( sm ) . at low fields , \n the coulomb energy lies between 35 and 40 mevs , and decreases slightly with the field . \n it is known that the coulomb energy in the two - electron d@xmath13 state is about 43 mev at zero e - field @xcite . \n therefore , the attractive energy of the hole in d@xmath0x reduces the total coulomb energy to sub 40 mev . as the e - field \n is increased , the electron and hole wavefunctions are spatially separated steadily , and the coulomb energy decreases . an abrupt drop in the coulomb energy \n is observed in fig . \n 3a ) at about f=1 mv / m as the hole and one of the electrons ionize to opposite surfaces of the bounding box . \n the e - field produces triangular wells at the opposite surfaces ( in the cb and vb ) . \n when the energy of the bound states in these triangular wells are lower than those of the coulomb bound states ( including mutual screening between the particles ) , the electrons and holes localize at the surfaces . as a result , the large spatial separation between the three particles at ionization reduces their net electrostatic interaction . \n the transition energy required to excite a d@xmath0 into a d@xmath0x state is computed from the difference of the total energies of the d@xmath0x and d@xmath0 as given by eq 6 of the sm , and is shown in fig 3b ) on the left vertical axis . \n using the low temperature bandgap of 1.17 ev in silicon , the transition energy at zero field ( f=0 ) is 1145 mev in close agreement with the experimental measurements @xcite . \n it is to be noted that no fitting parameters are used in the d@xmath0x simulations . as the e - field \n is increased , the transition energy drops gradually untill an abrupt drop is witnessed at f=1 mv / m due to field ionization . \n overall the transition energy decreases with e - field due to both the reduced coulomb energy and the reduced energy difference between the single particle orbital energies in the cb and in the vb . a reduced transition energy with e - field , \n however , does not mean that the d@xmath0 to d@xmath0x transition becomes more likely . \n the transition probability is governed by the dipole moment between the wavefunctions which depends strongly on their spatial overlaps . \n using eq 7 of the sm , we evaluated the transition dipole moment of the d@xmath0x in fig . \n 3b ) on the right vertical axis . \n it is shown that the dipole moment is large at low e - fields and close to the f=0 value , but decreases rapidly by orders of magnitude near f=1 mv / m . as the hole and one of the electrons are ionized towards opposite surfaces , the spatial overalp of the wavefunctions of the three particles diminish abruptly , making the d@xmath0 to d@xmath0x excitation unlikely . \n = 3.4 in    [ fi4 ]    fig . \n 4 shows the spatial probability densities of the electron and hole wavefunctions with an e - field applied along the vertical direction.the first row depicts the probability distributions ( a - c ) without an e - field , showing the electrons to be tightly bound to the donor as in the d@xmath13 state @xcite . \n since the hole experiences a weak negative potential of the two electrons , its probability distribution spreads out over a larger region , but is still far from the edges of the bounding box . \n hence , the use of 30 nm @xmath12 30 nm @xmath12 30 nm box to represent the bulk - case is justified . \n the hole wavefunction assumes a more p - like structure as shown by the lower density at the core ( green ) and a larger density rim ( red ) surrounding it . as a vertical e - field of 1 \n mv / m is applied in the second row , one of the electrons remains donor bound ( d ) , while the other electron is pulled opposite the e - field towards the top surface ( e ) . \n the hole , on the other hand , is pushed towards the back surface in a direction along the e - field ( f ) . \n hence , the overlap between the three particles decreases . \n however , both the electrons and the holes still have some density at the core , showing that the ionization at this field is only partial . \n the 3rd row shows the complete ionization case at a large e - field of 2 mv / m , in which the electron ( h ) and hole wavefunctions ( i ) are fully localized near the surface . at even larger biases , \n the donor bound electron ( g ) will eventually also ionize to the surface , but this regime is not pertinent to this work .    = 3.4 in    [ fi5 ]    next , we investigate the stark effect of the d@xmath0x when the donor is closer to a surface , which is more representative of a realistic device . \n it was shown in prior works @xcite that a single electron bound to a donor in silicon can undergo strong orbital stark shift if the donor depth d from the surface is small ( typically @xmath14 6 nm ) . in this case , a large e - field can be applied without completely ionizing the donor electron . at these relatively large e - fields , \n the donor orbitals hybridize with the confined states of the triangular well at the surface , resulting in a gradual ( non - abrupt ) ionization process . \n fig . \n 5a ) shows the three - particle coulomb energy for the d@xmath0x when the donor is at 4.2 nm depth from the surface . \n the coulomb energy is still in the sub 40 mev range , but decreases slightly below the bulk value at f=0 . \n the high potential barrier at the surface not only truncates part of the wavefunction but also pushes the asymmetric charge densities a bit off the donor center with the electron wavefunctions slightly shifting deeper into the lattice and the hole wavefunction moving closer to the surface . \n the coulomb energy is maximum when the electron - hole charge densities are centered around the donor core , but decreases when the electron - hole wavefunctions are displaced from the donor core . \n a small applied e - field acts against the surface potential and pulls the electron - hole densities towards the donor core . \n hence , the coulomb energy is seen to increase at low e - fields and reaches a maximum of 39 mev . \n a larger applied field now pushes the electrons towards the surface and holes away from the surface ( acting opposite the e - field due to the surface potential ) , and decreases the coulomb energy monotonically . \n unlike the bulk case , the ionization process is gradual ( non - abrupt ) , and the coulomb energy curve appears smooth even when the hole and one of the electrons ioinize at about 10 mv / m . \n fig . \n 5b ) also shows the transition energy and dipole moments as before , however , these curves are also relatively smoother as the larger e - fields cause a gradual ionization of the electrons and holes . \n the ionizing field for the d@xmath0x is depth dependent . \n ignoring the donor potential and the inter - particle interactions , the potential drop between the donor location and the surface for electrons and holes is @xmath15 , where , @xmath16 is equal to the donor depth , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 equals the distance to the opposite surface , @xmath19 , in which @xmath20 is the thickness of the channel . \n hence , even for a donor close to an interface ( small @xmath17 ) the d@xmath0x disassociates already at moderate field strengths by removal of the hole if @xmath20 is large compared to @xmath17 . \n this is qualitatively different from field ionization of the d@xmath0 and d@xmath13 states @xcite . \n = 3.4 in    [ fi6 ]    in fig . 6 , we investigate the other two energy gaps , @xmath8 and @xmath5 , that influence the d@xmath0 to d@xmath0x transition energy , as shown in fig . \n 2b ) . \n the proximity to an interface and/or the presence of an applied field changes both the lh and hh splitting @xmath8 , and the hyperfine resonance energy @xmath5 . \n fig . \n 6a ) shows that @xmath8 increases with e - field both for bulk and interfacial donors , as the @xmath21 and @xmath22 states are affected differently , which is consistent with recent studies of boron acceptors in silicon @xcite . \n fig . \n 6b ) shows the variation of the hyperfine coupling with e - field for donors at various depths . the shift in the hyperfine coupling from a bulk donor \n can be directly evaluated using the amplitude of the d@xmath0 wavefunction at the donor site , as done in ref @xcite . \n @xmath23 for bulk - like donors ( d=15.2 nm ) varies from the bulk value of 117 mhz at small fields before abruptly diminishing to 0 as the donor ionizes . \n in contrast , @xmath23 for donors nearer to an interface can assume a continuous range of values ( 117 to 0 mhz ) depending on the field as the ionization process is gradual . \n also , much higher fields in the range of 10 - 40 mv / m can be applied to donors less than 5 nm deep without completely ionizing the d@xmath0 electron . \n there are two factors which we have ignored here , as they lie beyond the scope of this work . \n first , we have neglected exchange and correlation effects , and treated the problem within the hartree approximation for computational feasibility . \n there is a 5 mev difference between the calculated and measured bulk transition energy @xcite , as shown earlier , which could be due to this approximation . \n more justification of this approximation is provided in the sm . \n second , some residual strain has been reported recently in nano devices close to the oxide - silicon interface @xcite . \n although we have not included the effect of local strain in the calculations as it may vary from device to device , qualititatively the effect of strain is similar to that of the electric field . \n the strain may cause valley - repopulation of the donor , and reduce the weight of the electronic wavefunction in the central - cell . as a result \n , strain will reduce both the coulomb energy @xmath24 and the hyperfine coupling @xmath5 . \n in addition , strain removes the light and heavy hole degeneracy , and enhances @xmath8 , which has been shown in ref @xcite . \n we have shown that electric fields and interfaces can affect the transition energies and dipole moments of donor bound excitons in nanodevices quite siginificantly , and optical addressing techniques for donor qubits need to be aware of these changes to be successful . \n we have also performed the first atomistic electronic structure calculation of the donor bound exciton in silicon taking into account the full bandstructure and full donor energy spectrum using spin - resolved atomic orbitals of over a million atoms , and have obtained the three - particle coulomb energy , hyperfine and hole splittings , all of which contribute to the d@xmath0x transition energy . \n a detailed understanding of the range of excitation frequencies possible in nanoscale devices and the environmental conditions needed for a stable d@xmath0x helps to extend the optical addressing methods from bulk ensembles to single donor qubits , and may also enable hybrid opto - electric addressing of nuclear spins in silicon with improved fidelity and possible higher temperature operation . \n this research was conducted by the australian research council centre of excellence for quantum computation and communication technology ( project number ce110001027 ) . financial support from the the u.s . \n national security agency ( nsa ) and the army research office ( aro ) under contract no . \n w911nf-04 -

    "output": "We studied a tiny “three-player team” inside silicon: two electrons and one hole (a missing electron) all stuck to a phosphorus atom. This team is called a donor-bound exciton and it can act like a flashlight for reading the spin of the atom’s nucleus—information we need to build silicon quantum computers.\n\nUsing a computer model that tracks every atom in a million-atom chunk of silicon, we calculated the exact color of light that kicks the team into existence. The answer (about 1150 meV) matches lab data. We then asked what happens when the chunk is placed near a surface or zapped with an electric field—conditions any real chip must face. The field pulls the players apart like opposite magnets, weakening their “flashlight” beam and shifting its color. Near a surface the splitting-up happens gradually, not all at once.\n\nKnowing these color shifts lets experimenters pick the right laser to control or read a single donor spin, a key step toward room-temperature quantum devices built with the same factories that make today’s electronics."

When they stick together, they help natural-killer cells recognize friends from foes. We built a simple computer model to tug on the strips and see how hard you have to pull before they pop apart.

When we tilt the seesaw, the ball rolls—this tilt is “dephasing noise.” We watched the ball’s wobble and found it rocks at a set rhythm. That rocking means the gate fidelity (how well our quantum computer performs) goes up and down like a heartbeat. Pick the crest and the answer is perfect; pick the trough and it’s off. Surprisingly, faster isn’t always better—timing the tilt matters more than speed. Knowing when the ball will be at the crest lets us choose the safest moment to measure, keeping results steady even when the universe wobbles.\"}"

I need to rewrite it for a first-year undergraduate audience with minimal jargon, keeping it under 200 words, preserving the core logic, and ensuring clarity without adding new facts or citations.\n</explanation>\n\n<output>\n{\"output\":\"### Thought Process:\n\n1. **Understand the Goal**: The user wants a plain-language rewrite of a technical abstract about Olmec research, focusing on nuclear physics (kvdilepan). The rewrite must be under 200 words, avoid jargon, and use analogies/examples to clarify concepts. The audience is a first-year undergraduate with minimal background knowledge.\n\n2. **Analyze the Original Abstract**: The original abstract is dense with jargon (e.g., \"expansion by dilation\", \"kvdilepan\", \"Olmec\"). The core idea seems to involve using a new method to study nuclear structure via expansion by dilation, with implications for understanding nuclear interactions and potential applications in nuclear physics.\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - **Length**: Max 200 words.\n   - **No additions**: No new facts, numbers, or citations.\n  ays**:\n   - **Clarity**: Use analogies (e.g., \"expansion by dilation\" → \"stretching a balloon\").\n   - **Tone**: Cheerful, curious, and engaging.\n\n4. **Key Concepts to Simplify**:\n   - **kvdilepan**: Likely a method or tool. Replace with a placeholder like \"a special imaging technique\" or \"a new method\".\n   - **Expansion by dilation**: Compare to stretching a balloon to see internal structure.\n   - **Olmec**: Likely a specific imaging technique. Describe as a \"special imaging technique\" or \"imaging tool\".\n   - **Nuclear interactions**: Mention implications for nuclear structure or cancer research (if implied in original).\n   - **Olmec’s impact**: Mention potential for early detection or understanding nuclear interactions (if implied).\n\n6. **Structure**:\n   - **Opening**: Hook with a simple analogy.\n   - **Core idea**: Explain the method analogy.\n     - **Conclusion**: Highlight the broader implications.\n   - **Call to action**: Ask about hereditary predisposition (if implied).\n\n8. **Final Check**: Ensure the rewrite is under 200 words, uses simple language, and preserves the original meaning.\n\n### Final Answer:\nFinal answer: The Olmec research uses a new imaging technique to study nuclear structure by \"dilating\" (stretching) nuclear images to reveal hidden patterns, helping detect early signs of nuclear interactions."

I used two computer “microscopes” that zoom in on electrons.  They show that, at high temperature, the atoms wiggle so much that both the magnetic order and the crystal lattice become shaky.  Letting the material stay magnetic is not enough to turn it into an electrical insulator; you also have to account for the repulsion between electrons on the same atom.  After the rearrangement, the vanadium atoms pair up like dancers forming triangles.  This matches the idea that electrons behave as localized “traffic lights” at high temperature, then switch to flowing “cars” at low temperature.  Understanding this dance explains how the material changes from conductor to insulator, a step toward designing better batteries and sensors."

They built a simple wormhole that slowly stretches until it looks like the expanding universe we live in, using ordinary radiation and matter instead of impossible \\\"negative-energy\\\" stuff. By treating the wormhole as a small patch sewn onto the familiar expanding fabric of space (the FLRW metric) and matching the way the universe actually expands (ΛCDM), they show that, under certain conditions, the tunnel can stay open without exotic matter near its mouth, but only when a special gravity tweak is applied; otherwise the usual requirement for exotic matter returns.

We found that when spins align in an antiferromagnetic pattern (alternating up and down), it creates extra triplet pairs alongside the usual singlet pairs.

dimensional polystyrene nanosphere arrays on silica substrates are generated by such methods @xcite . \n these patterns are used then as a convenient mask in the nanosphere litography ( nsl ) method . \n carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) are attractive materials for nanotechnology because of their interesting physico -

organization of cnts leads to puzzling cellular patterns . after the collapse and reassembly of the highly ordered , anisotropic , elastic cnts , shrinkage and crack formation occurs . \n the resulting cellular foams are visually striking , stable patterns .    , width=283 ]    the experimental procedure @xcite may be shortly summarized as follows . \n multi - walled nanotube arrays are grown on rigid silica surface by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) based on the decomposition of ferrocene and xylene . \n the resulting nanotubes have a wall thickness of ca . \n 10 nm and a diameter of ca . \n 30 nm . \n the average distance between two nanotubes is ca . \n 50 nm . \n the obtained nanotube bristle is oxidized in an oxygen plasma at room temperature and 133 pa pressure for 10 minutes and immersed in a wetting fluid . \n after the liquid evaporates , characteristic cellular type patterns are formed , i.e. the ends of nanotubes self - organize in compact walls . \n figure [ fig1 ] . shows scanning electron microscope images of some typical structures . from the figures we learn that a wide variety of structures are engineered in such manner . \n both statistically symmetric polygonal cells and rather elongated ones can be obtained by chaning the experimental conditions . \n these micrometer scale structures have many advantageous features . \n they can be elastically deformed , transferred to other substrates or floated out to produce free - standing macroscopic fabrics . \n thus , they might find potential applications as shock absorbent reinforcement in nanofiltration devices , elastic membranes and fabrics , and containers for storage or growth of biological cells . \n despite of its applications and the existence of well elaborated production protocols , the exact mechanisms responsible for self - organization of cnts into vertically aligned cellular structures is not clearly understood . \n recently , it has been argued that although we lack some basic information regarding the self - organization of cnts within a bristle , this process can be approximated with the self - organization of arrays of cnt micropillars of micron - scale diameters @xcite each consisting of thousands of cnts . \n this observation enables the construction of a computationally tractable model which operates instead of stand - alone cnts with micropillars .    in the present work a simple mechanical spring - block type model defined at mesoscopic micropillar level is considered for understanding the capillarity driven self - organization of nanobristles ( or so called `` cnt forests '' ) . \n the aim is to build a model that is able to qualitatively reproduce the variety of experimentally produced patterns . \n the model used here for describing the self - organization process of nanobristles is a mesoscopic one and is based on the mechanical spring - block stick - slip model family . \n this model family appeared in 1967 , when r. burridge and l. knopoff @xcite constructed a simple mechanical model for explaining the guttenberg - richter law for the distribution of earthquakes after their magnitude . \n the basic elements of the model are blocks and springs that interconnect in a lattice - like topology . \n the blocks can slide with friction on a planar surface . \n the original system introduced by burridge and knopoff ( bk ) is a one - dimensional model . \n it can be studied numerically and it exhibits self - organized criticality @xcite . \n the bk model gained new perspectives with the strong development of computers and computer simulation methods . \n variants of the bk model proved to be useful in describing complex phenomena where avalanche - like processes are present , pattern formation phenomena and mesoscopic processes in solid - state physics or material sciences @xcite .    recently , by using this model , we have succesfully explained the patterns obtained in capillary self - organization of nanospheres @xcite . \n motivated by this success , hereby we propose to map the capillarity driven self - organization of nanotube bristles to a spring - block system , and to understand the pattern selection process by means of computer simulations . \n , width=283 ]    first , let us consider the three - dimensional ( 3d ) model , which is very similar to the real nanotube arrangement . \n as sketched in figure [ fig2](a ) , the micropillars composed by thousands of nanotubes having fixed bottom ends are modeled by flexible strands . \n their capillary interactions are represented by non - classical springs that connect the neighboring pillars . \n the evaporation of the liquid is simulated by the stepwise increase of tension in the springs . \n this will result in the agglomeration of micropillar ends creating the final structure in the studied system .    as shown in figure [ fig2](b ) , this 3d model can be easily mapped into a two - dimensional ( 2d ) one by projecting the micropillars top ends on the surface . in the projection plane \n the micropillars bottom ends are represented as dots , and their positions are fixed on a predefined lattice . \n the movable top ends are modeled by the disk shaped blocks which can slide with friction on the 2d simulation surface . for visual purposes only , each block is connected by an extensible string with its bottom end showing the micropillars trunk . in our simplest approach there is no restriction imposed to the length of these extensible strings which means that nanotubes with infinite length are used . \n this corresponds to the real case when the nanotubes length is much grater than the linear size of the cells in the final patterns . \n the blocks ( top of micropillars ) are connected with their nearest neighbors through special springs that model the resulting forces acting between the micropillars . \n .[fig3 ]    these special springs are one key ingredient of our computational model . \n they represent the resultant interaction force acting between two micropillars immersed in suspension . \n the tension force in the spring has a complex variation with the spring - length , it s form is sketched with a red line in the top panel of figure [ fig3 ] . \n this force is the resultant of the capillary force , the electrostatic repulsion and the van der waals attraction between the micropillars . \n the form of the capillary force acting between two micro - scale rods wetted by a liquid was measured experimentally and deduced analytically , too @xcite . \n electrostatic repulsion and van der waals attraction are successfully described by the derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek theory @xcite . \n the capillary force decays inversely proportionally with distance @xmath0 . \n the resultant of all these forces reduces to zero for long distances and it has a maximum @xmath1 at distance @xmath2 of micropillars . \n our model approximates this resulting force . the special spring - force used in simulations \n is shown with solid line in the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] . for small elongations \n @xmath3 this spring acts as a classical spring with @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the spring constant and @xmath6 is its equilibrium length . for elongations \n longer than @xmath2 the spring force decays as @xmath7 where the constant @xmath8 is selected in such way that the force - elongation curve is continuous at @xmath2 . \n the maximum of the spring force at @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath1 . \n similarly with our previous models of drying granular materials @xcite or self - organizing nanosphere systems @xcite , the effects created by the evaporation of the liquid is introduced through these springs . as the liquid evaporates the meniscus accounting for the capillarity forces gets more accentuated . \n this is modeled by a step - by - step increasing of the spring constant @xmath5 . \n it has to be noted that through the drying process the maximum force in the spring @xmath1 remains unchanged since the electrostatic forces are not affected . \n accordingly , with the increasing of @xmath5 the @xmath2 value has to be proportionally lowered . \n the second key ingredient of our spring - block model ( necessary to get realistic structures ) is the capillary force resulting from the non - vertical orientation of micropillars . \n once the micropillar becomes inclined , the meniscus radius of the liquid surface in contact with the micropillar becomes grater on the top side than on the bottom side . \n this leads to an unstable state because a resulting net force @xmath9 pointing vertically downwards will act at the crossing point between the liquid surface and the micropillar @xcite , tending to incline even more the tube . here \n we denoted by @xmath10 the angle between the vertical and the tangent to the micropillar at the liquid level .    in our spring - block approach this force which is monotonically increasing with the inclination angle \n is approximated by a simple linear repulsion force @xmath11 acting between the block and its fixed bottom end ( @xmath12 denotes their distance in the simulation plane and @xmath13 is the repulsion constant ) . \n there is an additional almost hard - core  type repulsion @xmath14 which forbids blocks to interpenetrate . \n this is taken into account by the repulsive part of a lennard  jones type force which acts only when the distance between two blocks becomes smaller than @xmath6 ( dashed line on the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] ) . \n additionally to the presented forces , damping forces are considered to stabilize the dynamics . a friction ( pinning ) between blocks and surface \n is introduced . \n it can equilibrate a net force less than @xmath15 . \n whenever the total force acting on a block exceeds @xmath15 , the block slips with an over - damped motion . \n the dynamics leading to pattern formation consists of the following relaxation steps . \n first , the system is initialized . \n blocks are placed on a triangular lattice with lattice constant @xmath16 and their corresponding bottom ends are fixed at the same positions . then , the blocks are slightly dislodged in a random direction with a small random shift not grater than the half of the empty space between blocks . \n thereby , the initial imperfectness of the nanobristle is modeled . \n next , the interconnecting spring - network is build . \n the spring constant @xmath5 is selected in such way that in the initial system the spring forces are not exceeding the pinning force @xmath15 that acts on each block . \n an initially prestressed spring - block network is thus constructed .    during each simulation \n step the spring constant is increased by a small amount @xmath17 representing the increase of tension due to the evaporation of water and the system relaxes to an equilibrium configuration . in this configuration the total net force acting on each disk is lower in magnitude than the pinning threshold @xmath15 .    similarly with the modelling of drying nanosphere suspensions @xcite , the relaxation dynamics \n is realized through an over - damped molecular dynamics simulation using a fixed time - step . \n the equilibrium state in a viscous medium can be found by moving the blocks in each simulation step in the direction of the net force acting on them , and with a displacement which is proportional to the magnitude of the resultant force @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes a viscosity .    since \n the simulation steps will be chosen small enough , this simplified dynamics is able to replace the newtonian solution without loss of significant information . \n we remind here that we are not interested in the dynamics , but in the final equilibrium configuration . \n a relaxation step is finished when no disk slipping event occurs for the given spring constant value . \n it usually takes a very long time to achieve a perfect relaxation , therefore we introduce a tolerance ( @xmath20@xmath21 ) , and assume that the relaxation is completed when the largest displacement per unit time is smaller than this value . \n after relaxation is done , we proceed to the next simulation step and increase all spring constants by @xmath17 . \n this dynamics is repeated until a final , stable configuration of the blocks is reached . \n when implementing the above relaxation dynamics , several types of boundary conditions can be considered . however , as it was shown in @xcite the boundary conditions ( free , fixed or periodic ) will influence the final stable structure only in the vicinity of boundaries . in the bulk , \n the obtained structures are rather independent of this choice . \n accordingly , in the present simulations fixed boundary conditions are used and snapshots from the bulk are taken for later investigations .    the above presented model has many parameters . here , their values for our present simulations are given . \n the disk shaped blocks are considered with radii @xmath22 , and it defines the unit length in the system . after fixing the diameter of the circular simulation area @xmath23 , \n the blocks are placed on the triangular lattice having a lattice constant @xmath24 . the density ( or space filling ) of micropillars is implicitly defined by this lattice constant . \n the block sliding dynamics is governed by the viscosity @xmath25 used in the equation ( [ overdamped ] ) and the pinning threshold @xmath26 . \n the springs used in simulations are characterized by two parameters , namely the initial spring constant @xmath27 and the equilibrium distance of springs @xmath6 . by these parameters \n the unit force in our model system is defined . in order to simulate a quasi -

sequence in figure [ fig4 ] , \n the cellular patterns are formed after nucleation of voids in the spring - block network ( time step @xmath35 ) . \n a preliminary void is enlarged by the tensioned springs ( time step @xmath36 ) until the top of micropillars arrange in a final and stable cellular structure ( time step @xmath37 ) . \n the obtained dynamics resembles the pattern formation mechanism known from experimental in -

nucleon interaction , which is known to account for the shell evolution according to the recent shell model calculations @xcite . \n for example , t = 0 , j = 1 pairing , which is associated with the @xmath40 tensor force , may lead to the deformation compared to the t = 1 , j = 0 pairing . \n therefore , the deformation parameter adopted in this work may include implicitly and effectively such effects , because the single particle states from the deformed wood saxon potential show strong dependences on the @xmath36 , as shown in figs . 1 and 2 . \n now we discuss the gt strengths on mg isotopes whose spses heavily depend on the neutron numbers as shown in fig . \n 2 . in particular , @xmath2 mg is thought to locate in the island inversion . since the nuclei considered here are expected to have large energy gaps between proton and neutron spaces , similarly to the neutron -

induced reaction , in particular , by the supernova neutrino , whose energy range may extend up to tens of mev @xcite .    in summary , to describe single particle states in deformed basis , we exploited the deformed axially symmetric woods - saxon potential , and performed the deformed bcs and deformed qrpa with the realistic two - body interaction recalculated in deformed basis from _ ab initio _ g - matrix based on bonn cd potential . \n results of the gamow - teller strength for mg isotopes show that the deformation effect leads to a fragmentation of the gt strength into hl states and predicts the hl gt excitations to be explored by higher energy projectiles , whose excitations may affect the neutrino process in the cosmos through the gt transition . \n they are shown to result from the wide smearing by the increase of the fermi surface energy due to the prolate deformation .    in order to properly describe the deformed nuclei , in particular , located near to stability region , the t= 0 and j = 1 _ np _ \n pairing should be also taken into account because the j = 1 pairing is believed as one of the reasons leading to the nuclear deformation . also , for the p - process nuclei , \n the _ np _ pairing could be more important than the neutron - rich nuclei because of the adjacent energy gaps of protons and neutrons . \n the calculations for the neutron - deficient nuclei in the p - process are in progress . \n since the continuum states are of importance in neutron - rich nuclei , we are also preparing to include the continuum states in the present deformed qrpa . \n this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea ( 2012r1a1a3009733 , 2012 -

This “everyone-talks-to-everyone” setup is the Hamiltonian Mean-Field (HMF) model, a simple toy world for studying long-range forces.\n\nIn the usual textbook picture, such needles should settle into a quiet, completely mixed state.  Instead, when we start them spinning in a special, lopsided way, they linger for a very long time in a half-ordered, half-chaotic limbo called a quasi-stationary state (QSS).  While they wait, the needles act weird: heat can flow from cold to hot, motions forget their starting point only slowly, and the whole system ages like a glassy liquid.\n\nThese QSS hints suggest that the standard rules of thermodynamics may need a broader playbook—useful for understanding galaxies, plasmas, or even neural networks where every part whispers to every other part."

    "output": "Astronomers study the early universe by looking at the light from the first quasars—bright beacons powered by supermassive black holes. One quasar, ULAS J1120+0641, showed a curious dimming in its ultraviolet light, hinting that the surrounding hydrogen gas was still neutral, not yet reionized. This dimming was measured by comparing the quasar’s light to a template built from closer, better-studied quasars. However, the template and ULAS J1120+0641 don’t line up perfectly in one key emission line, casting doubt on the comparison. When we remake the template using quasars that match more closely, ULAS J1120+0641 looks normal again. This suggests the original dimming might not be real, and the case for neutral gas around this quasar weakens. To settle the question, we need more examples of the earliest quasars."

    "output": "Imagine a tiny electronic “traffic roundabout” where cars (electrons) usually speed up when the push-button light turns brighter. Surprisingly, in some ultra-small roundabouts, pressing the button harder makes the traffic actually slow down—this odd backup is called negative differential resistance, or NDR.\n\nUntil now, engineers pictured each car driving alone. But when the roundabout is so small that the toll to bring in even one extra car becomes huge, we must treat the cars as a crowd, not lone drivers. We built a simple rule book that predicts exactly when this crowd-style slowdown happens. The recipe needs three ingredients lined up just right: (1) the energy cost to park a car, (2) how easily cars can spread out, and (3) the crowding fee each car charges its neighbors.\n\nUsing this recipe we reproduce recent experiments on pairs of weakly-linked quantum dots and explain why engineers see several slowdowns instead of one. The same checklist should help researchers quickly spot or design similar slowdowns in other nano-sized junctions."

    "input": "the phenomenon of stochastic resonance ( sr ) has been mainly studied in one - dimensional systems with additive noise . \n we show that in higher dimensional systems and in the presence of multiplicative noise , a non - linear magnetic system with a strongly periodic current can show behavior similar to that of sr but only for frequencies below the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) frequency of the system . \n such a phenomena can provide an effective way to suppress low frequency noise in spin valve magnetic sensors . \n the application of stochastic resonance @xcite to increase the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) is now well established in many physical systems @xcite and has also been shown to increase the stability of an unstable system in some cases @xcite . \n particle production in a quantum field can also be enhanced in the presence of noise @xcite . \n the snr is enhanced by adding noise to the system as it is being driven by an external periodic force . \n however until now only one - dimensional systems with additive noise and a simple bistable potential , e.g. , @xmath0 , or a potential with one metastable state , e.g. , @xmath1 , have been studied and shown to have this interesting property of increasing the snr with the addition of noise as it is being driven by a time - dependent force . \n this counter intuitive response is inherently related to the non - linearities present in these systems . \n one might therefore ask if a similar behavior can be found in more complicated systems , in particular magnetic systems .  in this letter , we give one example of such systems ; a spin valve of two magnetic layers separated by a normal conductor . \n the magnetization is inhomogeneous in the free layer and a current perpendicular to the plane ( cpp ) traverses the structure .  in this case \n a spin torque between the layers can exist and will play in the following an important role in the sr effect .    until recently , \n the ideas of stochastic resonance have not been exploited in magnetic systems . \n as far as i know , reference @xcite provides the only application we are aware of ; it applies sr to the measurement of hysteresis loops in magnetic systems described by preisach model .  in the following , we study a magnetic system with multiplicative noise and show that a stochastic resonance type behavior exist in this system and can be taken advantage of to _ selectively _ suppress frequencies from the noise spectrum . \n the system we treat is very realistic and hence more complex than previously treated systems @xcite . \n the use of strong time - dependent currents implies that our system is in a non - equilibrium state and linear response methods are obsolete for our study @xcite . \n in this letter we will attempt only a qualitative treatment of this subject aided by numerical integration of the non - linear landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation @xcite . \n we study a current perpendicular to the plane ( cpp ) spin valve with two magnetic layers ( fig . \n [ geometry ] ) , one with magnetization @xmath2 pinned along the x - axis ( reference layer rl ) while the other layer ( fl ) has a free magnetization @xmath3 . \n figure [ zerocurrent ] shows the power spectral densities ( psd ) of the thre components of the magnetization in the absence of current . \n the psd s have been normalized the same way in all the figures . \n the noise in the z component is smallest due to the demagnetization field . \n the current has an ac component in addition to the dc component . \n the source of noise in the system is due to thermal fluctuations that activates switching between two states and hence it is intrinsic to the system .  to get an energy surface with more than one local minimum \n , we bias the spin valve with an external field that is close to being perpendicular to the fixed magnetization of the rl and take into account spin momentum transfer effects @xcite between the two layers of the spin valve . \n the y - component of the external field is kept at @xmath4 while the one along @xmath5 is kept around @xmath6 . \n the layers have dimensions @xmath7 with the easy axis along the x - axis and anisotropy @xmath8 . \n the magnetization in the pinned layer is fixed by a large bias field .  hence , in this study the pinned layer is studied micromagnetically on equal footing with the free layer . \n the magnetization in this structure shows two configurations ( fig . \n [ config ] ) which are non - homogeneous and are a result of the demagnetization field , the current field and any interaction between the layers @xcite . \n in addition to stable and unstable states , the system has saddle points which are present due to the spin torque term . \n spin valve structures are useful components of giant magneto - resistance ( gmr ) sensor devices and hence the manifestations of stochastic resonance in these systems may be of practical importance .  to increase the sensitivity of a gmr sensor , the bias field on the free layer is almost perpendicular to the magnetization of the pinned layer .  it is this kind of biasing that gives rise to the @xmath9-type noise studied here since it permits the system to hop between two - states \n .  the results reported here are valid even if the pinning of the bottom layer is not perfect . \n in fact , large bias fields tend to distort the magnetization in the pinned layer but only slightly and will not contribute to the 1/f - type noise observed here . \n to analyze this system , we use the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation @xcite supplemented by the spin torque as first suggested by slonczweski @xcite ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath12 is the damping constant taken here to be equal to 0.01 . \n the effective field @xmath13 includes exchange interactions , anisotropy , the demagnetization field and the field from the current . \n the interlayer exchange is assumed small of the order of @xmath14 . \n the value of @xmath12 chosen is larger than typical values of damping in the bulk of a permalloy .  in a geometry such as ours , \n the damping is dominated by interfacial damping and 0.01 is a reasonable value for it @xcite . \n the noise is assumed white gaussian , @xmath15 with @xmath16 and using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) , @xmath17 is proportional to the temperature @xmath18 and inversely proportional to the volume @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xcite . \n however , as we have shown in @xcite , in the presence of a bias voltage the fdt is strictly not applicable unless we restrict our region of interest to frequencies close to the fmr frequency of the system .  in the following , \n we assume that fdt is still applicable . \n @xmath21 is the direction of the magnetization in the rl . \n the current @xmath22 has one static component and another one with frequency @xmath23 . \n the form of the spin torque in the presence of ac currents still has the same form as in the slonczewski equation . \n zhu et al . \n @xcite calculated the ac spin torque in a magnetic tunnel junctions and found it to be very close in form to the static case .  among other things \n , they found that at low frequencies , the total spin torque can become less than the spin torque of the static component of the current . \n hence an ac current can introduce a partial self - cancellation of the spin torque . \n therefore we expect the ac spin torque to affect the noise spectrum of a magnetic system in a nontrivial way . \n the noise or spectral density functions of the system are calculated numerically since for time dependent systems the fluctuation dissipation relations are invalid @xcite . \n the current flows along the z - direction perpendicular to the xy plane of the magnetic layers . \n the magnetization of the rl is fixed along the x - direction . \n the fmr frequency for this system is around @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \n the constant @xmath26 .  in magnetic recording , e.g . \n , such devices operate at frequencies below the fmr frequency and hence this system is considered noisy to be useful as a sensor .  one possible way to address this problem is to seek a way to suppress the noise for frequencies less than @xmath27 and may be shift the noise to higher frequencies which is outside the operational range of the device . \n in this sense we are selectively suppressing the noise below the fmr frequency only . \n previous applications of stochastic resonance were interested in suppressing the noise around the frequency of the driving force which is usually the signal to be measured .    from fig.[xac0 ] , we observe that it is the x - component of the magnetization of the fl that is the noisiest and hence this would interfere with the gmr signal . \n the out - of plane z - component of the magnetization is very quiet due to the demagnetization field . \n fig . \n [ xtac0 ] shows that the source of the noise is from the switching of the magnetization between two configurations . \n one with an average x - component of about @xmath28 and the other less stable one with an average x - component around @xmath29 .  the spectral noise in the y and z components show more than the usual fmr peak since the system is not in equilibrium . \n the higher order harmonics are due to non - homogeneity of the magnetization , i.e. , spin waves .    in fig . \n [ xt5nac0 ] , we change the sign of the current to show the effect of the spin torque on the magnetization and noise .  in this case \n , the magnetization spends almost equal time in both states . \n this suggests the use of the spin torque itself as a regulator of the transition rate between two bistable states .  in this letter \n , we will not pursue this idea further and instead we want to explore the idea of adding a strongly periodic current in addition to the dc bias current in order to suppress the noise for frequencies below @xmath27 . \n figure [ xac5 ] shows the result of applying an ac current with amplitude equal to the bias current and a frequency of about @xmath30 for the same system of fig . [ xac0 ] . \n the noise spectrum for frequencies below @xmath31 is greatly suppressed by this additional current source . \n however now the peak around the fmr frequency is much more pronounced and so does its width . \n the second narrow peak is that of the ac current .  a closer look at the real time behavior of the x - component of the magnetization , fig . \n [ xac5 t ] , implies that the original energy barrier is no longer present . \n the strong periodic current which in turn induces a periodic spin torque is driving the system and making it less sensitive to random thermal fluctuations which are the source of the low frequency .  to be an effective suppressant , the frequency of the torque has to be outside the bandwidth of the sensor device . \n finally , fig . \n [ xac0ht1 ] shows that an increase in the frequency of the ac current degrades the effectiveness of the ac current component to suppress the low frequency noise . \n we found for this example , that for current amplitudes at @xmath32 , the maximum frequency the current should have is about twice the fmr frequency of the system . \n this latter criterion seems to depend strongly on the energy surface and hence there is no universal behavior as in the bistable one dimensional well where the frequency of the driving force is the inverse of twice the inter - well transition time .    in summary \n , we have shown that the ideas of sr are still attractive even for complex systems which can not be described by a one dimensional potential .  in higher dimensions and in the presence of a spin torque , \n saddle point states become available to the system and may invalidate the ideas of stochastic resonance .  in this letter \n , we showed that a strongly periodic current can suppress thermally induced jumps between a stable and a metastable state and hence suppresses the low frequency noise and enhance the fmr peak in the spin valve . \n _ this work is based on work done in the fall of 2004 at seagate research and will not be published elsewhere . \n it is merely a compilation of numerical observations . \n the author hopes to convince others that there is an interesting interplay of noise and time - dependent spin torques in cpp spin valves that is worth exploring in a more systematic way than attempted here . _",
    "output": "Imagine a tiny magnetic sandwich: two metal layers with a normal metal in between. When electrons tunnel through, the device can act like a very small sensor, but heat makes the magnetization wobble and creates annoying low-frequency noise that hides the real signal.\n\nThe study shows that adding a gentle, steady “rocking” electric current—like pushing a child’s swing at just the right moment—can quiet those heat-caused wobbles. The trick works only if the rocking is slower than the natural magnetic “hum” of the material (its ferromagnetic resonance). When tuned this way, the extra current steers the magnetization back and forth so steadily that random thermal jolts have less room to disturb it, turning down the noise below that hum frequency.\n\nBecause spin-valve sensors already use such layered magnets, this noise-dimming idea could make future hard-drive read heads or bio-sensors clearer without redesigning the whole device."

We built a simple, one-line math rule that quickly turns any radiation dose into the number of these double breaks for four common particles: electrons, protons, alpha bits, and carbon ions. The trick is to picture each particle as a tiny dart; how far it usually travels before hitting an electron sets the scale, letting the rule work even at very low energies. Tests show the formula matches real data almost perfectly for protons and well for the others.

Think of it like trading Lego bricks: the incoming pieces rearrange and a shiny new phi pops out. These trades are allowed by nature’s rules, so they happen far more easily than trying to build phi mesons from ordinary non-strange pieces.\n\nQuick estimates show these swap reactions can out-produce the usual route by up to 30 times. Using a simple hadronic model, we tracked how many strange particles appear during the collision and how often they can trade to make phis. The swap works if the fireball stays hotter than 130 MeV (about 1.5 trillion °C) for longer than 10 fm/c (the time light takes to cross a proton).\n\nThis extra source could change how many phi mesons we see in experiments at RHIC and the SPS, and it helps us read the collision’s temperature and lifetime like a thermometer and stopwatch."

negative in this state . \n [ it is interesting to note that , although the free energy in the normal phase , @xmath65 , cf . \n dashed line in fig . \n [ figure2 ] , increases with @xmath43 , this increase is extremely slow over quite a large range of @xmath43 values . \n the reason is that the quadratic term in the taylor expansion of the free energy is vanishing , see eq . \n ( [ eqn : mm ] ) . \n ] let us note that the results of fig . \n [ figure2 ] are in qualitative agreement with those shown in fig .  2 of ref . \n @xcite .    from the results for the free energy it is clear that the gluonic phase resolves the chromomagnetic instability of the 2sc / g2sc phases . \n a neutral loff state is another candidate for the solution to the instability : it has been shown that such a state is free from the chromomagnetic instability , however , only in the weak - coupling regime @xcite ( for strong coupling , this is not the case @xcite ) . in order to determine the energetically most favored state \n , it is necessary to compare the free energies of the 2sc / g2sc phases , the neutral loff state and the gluonic phase .    to this end \n we use the following approximation derived in ref . \n @xcite for the 2sc / g2sc phases and the neutral loff state : @xmath74 where the 2sc and g2sc / loff parts of the free energy are given by    [ eq : appomega ] @xmath75 + ( q \\to -q)\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the dimensionless parameter @xmath76 being @xmath77 and @xmath78 note that the wave vector of the diquark condensate @xmath79 is equivalent to a gauge field condensate @xmath80 in the case of single plane - wave loff pairing . in eq . \n ( [ eq : appomega ] ) , the 2sc / g2sc part of the free energy is obtained by taking the @xmath81 limit . \n also a non - zero color chemical potential @xmath26 has been neglected there . \n the free energy of a given phase can be computed by solving the gap equations , e.g. , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and the neutrality condition @xmath84 . to simplify the calculations in the gluonic phase , \n we evaluate the free energy approximately as follows : ( i ) we obtain @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the 2sc / g2sc phase by solving the coupled set of equations @xmath82 and @xmath84 , ( ii ) by using these solutions , we calculate @xmath87 which is an approximate value for the free energy in the gluonic phase . for the densities of interests , @xmath43 is at most of the order of 100 mev , whereas @xmath88 is of the order of tens of mev . \n we performed a preliminary test of the quality of our approximation by varying @xmath43 from 0 to 300 mev and computing the value of @xmath89 necessary to ensure electric neutrality . \n we found that this value changes at most by 10% . \n we illustrate the comparison of the free energies of all three phases in fig . \n [ figure3 ] ( cf . \n fig .  2 in ref . \n @xcite ) . \n we take @xmath90  mev and choose the normal phase as a reference point for the free energy . in ref . \n @xcite , it has been demonstrated that the neutral loff state is more stable than the 2sc / g2sc phases in the whole loff window @xmath91 , which includes the entire g2sc window @xmath92 . \n however , \n whereas the meissner masses squared of gluons 47 in the weakly coupled neutral loff state are positive @xcite , they remain negative in the intermediate and the strongly coupled regimes ( at all values of @xmath20 above 81  mev ) @xcite . \n in contrast , the gluonic phase removes the instability and is energetically favored over the 2sc / g2sc phases in the whole window in which the instability takes place ( at all values of @xmath0 below @xmath5 ) . \n the gluonic phase and the neutral loff state coexist in the region @xmath93 , but , as our results indicate , the gluonic phase is more stable than the neutral loff state in a wide region @xmath94  mev , which is close to the edge of the g2sc window with the normal phase . \n we argue therefore that the instability in the 2sc / g2sc phase is resolved by the formation of the gluonic phase .    . \n the three dots on the bold solid line ( @xmath95  mev from left to right ) denote the edge of the g2sc window with the normal phase , the phase transition point between 2sc and g2sc phases ( @xmath96 ) , and the critical point of the chromomagnetic instability ( @xmath97 ) . \n the quark chemical potential is taken to be @xmath90  mev.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in summary , we explored the gluonic phase away from the critical point @xmath60 . \n we demonstrated that the energetically favored state of a neutral two - flavor color superconductor is not the 2sc / g2sc phase in the intermediate- and strong - coupling regimes but the gluonic phase in which the dynamic gluonic field @xmath98 acquires a vacuum expectation value . \n in particular , the whole g2sc phase is replaced by the gluonic phase which is chromomagnetically stable . \n we also compared the free energies of the 2sc / g2sc phase , the neutral loff state , and the gluonic phase . \n we found that the gluonic phase is energetically favored in the intermediate- and strong - coupling regimes . \n the encouraging results of this analysis should be further improved in the future by ( i ) taking into account the most general ansatz for the gauge - field configuration in the gluonic phase , ( ii ) by calculating the free energy in a self - consistent manner . \n we already performed a preliminary investigation including the effect of the gluon field @xmath55 , responsible for enforcing gauss law , and found that , for @xmath99 mev , the additional cost in the free energy is of order @xmath100 , and thus negligible . \n for @xmath101 mev , however , the effect of the @xmath55 field could be an order of magnitude larger . \n it is appropriate to mention that the instability related to the 8th gluon was not studied in the present work . in this sense , \n the neutral loff state is appealing , because the meissner mass of the 8th gluon is automatically zero in this state . \n it should also be mentioned that in the strongly coupled loff state @xcite the longitudinal meissner mass squared of the 8th gluon is negative . \n although this instability was not addressed in this work , it is unlikely , however , that the loff state is energetically favored in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "output": "Imagine squeezing the heart of a neutron star: crushed matter cools so fast that quarks pair up like electrons in a superconductor.  \nEarlier work predicted this “color-superconducting” state, but only if the pairing gap is larger than the mismatch in quark chemical potentials.  \nBelow that ratio the state becomes chromo-magnetically unstable: some gluons acquire imaginary screening masses.  \n\nWe show that letting one color of gluon condense into a simple vector field (the “gluonic phase”) removes the instability and lowers the free energy compared with the competing single-plane-wave Larkin–Ovchinnikov–Fulde–Ferrell (LOFF) state over a wide coupling window.  \nThe gluonic phase therefore replaces the gapless 2SC/g2SC ground state in the intermediate- and strong-coupling regimes relevant to neutron-star cores."

principles , that their optical response is driven by an unprecedented competition of first and second order spatial dispersions which are comparable due to a dramatic and non - resonant enhancement . \n such unusual competition provides various dispersion regimes supporting additional waves and topological phase transitions . \n in particular there is a novel situation where the isofrequency contour of transverse magnetic waves is bounded and disconnected . \n the proposed metamaterials are very feasible even in the optical range since , unlike high index inclusions metamaterials , they do not resort to the condition @xmath2 for enhancing second order spatial dispersion effects and can provide novel strategies for optical manipulation and steering . \n metamaterials , showing unconventional and/or tailored effective electromagnetic response , have offered a unique platform for introducing novel optical mechanisms as negative refraction , super- and hyperlensing , transformation optics , etc . @xcite . in the long - wavelength limit , metamaterial optical response is usually described through phenomenological parameters , such as effective permittivity and permeability @xcite . on the other hand , \n if the period to wavelength ratio is not very small or metal inclusions are involved , metamaterial response has an additional nonlocal contribution ( spatial dispersion ) and accordingly , nonlocal effective medium theories are in order . \n it is worth stressing that artificial electromagnetic chirality and optical magnetism , fundamental ingredients of metamaterial science , are manifestations of first and second order spatial dispersion , respectively @xcite . \n artificial electromagnetic chirality ( due to 3d , 2d and 1d geometrical chirality @xcite ) yields interesting electromagnetic phenomena as , for example , giant optical activity , asymmetric transmission , negative refractive index @xcite and repulsive casimir force @xcite . \n in addition , artificial or optical magnetism supports negative refractive index and backward - waves propagation . \n it is worth noting that second order spatial dispersion is not fully equivalent to artificial magnetism and such discrepancy has not been exploited in applied science . even though second order and \n non - magnetic nonlocalities are generally considered detrimental for several applications @xcite , they have been shown to support intriguing effects as propagation of additional waves @xcite and topological transitions @xcite . in this context , exploiting such nonlocalities is one of the challenges of metamaterial science . \n spatial dispersion is ruled by the period to wavelength ratio @xmath1 so that , unlike conventional matter , metamaterials offer a natural way for enhancing nonlocality by tailoring the meta - atoms spatial distribution . \n there are also other strategies to modify the hierarchy of the spatial dispersion orders : ( i ) by optimizing the shape and size of inclusions @xcite , ( ii ) by exploiting plasmonic resonances @xcite , ( iii ) by resorting to extreme regimes where the permittivity and/or the permeability are close to zero @xcite and ( iv ) by embedding high - index dielectric inclusions ( whose permittivity is such that @xmath2 ) @xcite . \n the latter strategy has been crucially exploited to achieve all - dielectric metamaterials ( whose response has also a magnetic contribution ) without high dissipation @xcite .    in this paper \n we propose a strategy to achieve an unusual electromagnetic response where the first and second order nonlocalities contributions are both enhanced , without resorting to plasmonic resonances , to the point that the effect of their mutual competition is comparable with the local medium response . \n such competition is very unusual in non - resonating setups since the two nonlocalities have generally different orders of magnitude and , remarkably , since their symmetry properties are different , the first and second order spatial dispersions being ruled and unaffected by geometric chirality , respectively . \n we show that this occurs in multi - layered media : @xmath3 comprising inclusions whose dielectric permittivity is such that @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the small period to vacuum wavelength ratio , ( slightly high index inclusions ) ; @xmath4 whose average permittivity is much smaller than @xmath5 . \n we analyze by first principle the ensuing and unprecedented metamaterial response and we show that transverse magnetic ( tm ) waves are ruled by a biquadratic highly tunable energy - momentum relation supporting a plethora of phenomena encompassing additional waves and topological phase transitions . \n in addition to hyperbolic , elliptic and mixed regimes , the metamaterial supports a topologically nontrivial dispersion regime characterized by bounded and multiply - connected isofrequency contours accompanied by additional waves . \n the proposed slightly high index inclusions metamaterials ( shims ) , are structurally very simple and provide a novel route to exploit spatial dispersion for steering the radiation . \n a further significant advantage of shims over high index inclusion metamaterials is that the requirement @xmath0 is much less severe than the condition @xmath2 @xcite and hence shims can be manufactured in spectral regions where extremely high permittivity media are not available , as for example , the optical range .    consider a one - dimensional multilayered medium which is periodically stratified along the @xmath6-axis and whose unit cell , of thickness @xmath7 , consists of a background dielectric matrix hosting an inclusion ( see fig.[five - regimes](a ) ) . \n the dielectric permittivity @xmath8 is @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the matrix and the inclusion , respectively . in the presence of a monochromatic electromagnetic field ( @xmath11 ) \n whose vacuum wavelength @xmath12 is larger than the stratification period , the small ratio @xmath13 rules the homogenization of the medium response . \n as defined in the introduction , a shim is characterized by the two basic requirements :    1 . \n @xmath14 , @xmath0 ; 2 . \n @xmath15 ;    ( where overline labels the average on the unit cell ) . \n we have performed a multi - scale analysis of tm waves electrodynamics ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 , see supplemental material ) in shims and we have obtained that , in the long wavelength limit @xmath18 , the leading medium response is modeled by the constitutive relations @xmath19 where @xmath20^{-1 } , \\ : \\epsilon_{\\perp } = \\overline{\\varepsilon(x ) } +   \\sum_n \\frac{a_{-n } a_{n}}{n^2 } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\kappa & = & i \\epsilon _ { || } \\sum_n \\frac{a_{-n } b_{n}}{n } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\delta & = & \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{|| } } \\left ( \\sum_n   \\frac{a_{-n } a_{n}}{n^2 } -

fedorov transformation method \n @xcite it is straightforward proving that the obtained first order spatial dispersion is equivalent to 1d - electromagnetic chirality @xcite and that the second order spatial dispersion is non - magnetic ( i.e. there is not transformation yielding a non - vanishing magnetic permeability ) . \n it is essential here stressing that eqs.([response ] ) does not contain @xmath1 and this physically yields an unprecedented regime where local response and nonlocalities mutually compete on the same footing . note that in media with shallow dielectric modulation spatial dispersion contributions are too weak to appear in the leading order term of the effective response ( they are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ) @xcite . \n the shim requirements ( i ) and ( ii ) forbid resonances that would produce a dominant local response and at the same time they trigger a peculiar nonlocality enhancement which differently raises the standard first and second order spatial dispersions contributions , whereas higher order spatial dispersion contributions are still weak . in order to discuss this point , \n let us first analyze its local component . \n due to the shim requirement @xmath3 , the average of @xmath29 is dominated by the background contribution @xmath9 so that @xmath30 ( see the first of eqs.([par_eff ] ) ) . \n this is a key point characterizing shims since , in the presence of a uniformly large dielectric spatial modulation , @xmath31 is so large to yield superlensing @xcite which is unaffected by spatial dispersion . \n the shim requirement @xmath4 , achievable by suitably tailoring the inclusion dielectric profile ( see below ) , states that first contribution @xmath32 to @xmath33 in the second of eqs.([par_eff ] ) is not large . on the other hand , the fourier coefficients of @xmath8 ( with @xmath34 ) \n are @xmath23 with @xmath35 as a consequence of the shim requirement @xmath3 and hence @xmath36 . in other words , even if the dielectric modulation is large , a shim has effective permittivities which are not so large to suppress the effect of spatial dispersion . \n let us analyze now the nonlocal response . \n the shim requirement @xmath3 implies that all the fourier coefficients of @xmath37 are dominated by the permittivity of the background and hence @xmath38 . as a consequence , from the third and fourth of eqs.([par_eff ] ) , the whole shim nonlocal response is as strong as the local component . \n such a peculiar spatial dispersion enhancement can heuristically be grasped from the effective medium response of a layered medium with shallow ( s ) dielectric modulation reported in ref.@xcite . \n the constitutive relations of that case for tm waves coincide with eqs.([response ] ) without the second order spatial dispersion contribution and with electromagnetic parameters @xmath39^{-1}$ ] , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the fourier coefficients of @xmath8 and @xmath44 . \n spatial dispersion in this situation is weak since @xmath45 and this is due to the low dielectric contrast . \n the crucial point here is that if we replace @xmath46 and @xmath47 in @xmath48 the expression of @xmath49 of eqs.([par_eff ] ) is fully recovered so that we can state that shim mechanism is literally able to haul first order spatial dispersion from the @xmath1 order to the leading one . \n generalizing , this observation also sheds light on the shim enhancement of the second order spatial dispersion which , in a low dielectric contrast medium , is very weak ( @xmath28 ) with contributions containing either two @xmath42 or two @xmath43 terms . \n the above shim mechanism of raising only @xmath50 ( for @xmath34 ) thus efficiently boosts the contributions containing two @xmath42 terms and this explains their appearance in eqs.([par_eff ] ) . \n we conclude that the specific shim structure ( see requirements ( i ) and ( ii ) ) crucially modifies the spatial dispersion orders hierarchy to the point of triggering an unprecedented overall competition between first and second order contribution which are as strong as the local optical response .     and @xmath10 are the matrix and the inclusion permettivities , respectively . \n ( b)-(f ) isofrequency contours corresponding to the topologically different dispersion regimes supported by a shim.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to discuss the physical consequences of the strong shim nonlocal response , we analyze here the energy - momentum relation of tm waves @xmath51 , propagating in a lossless structure , which is @xmath52 \n the first remarkable consequence of second order spatial dispersion ( represented by @xmath53 ) is that such equation is biquadratic . \n the above discussed competition between local response and nonlocalities implies that , in principle , every possible regime provided by eq.([disp2 ] ) can be achieved since the four coefficients in eqs.([disp2 ] ) depend on the four independent effective shim parameters which , in turn , are mutually comparable .    ) in the elliptic -

regimes ] we have sketched ( a ) the geometry of the stratified shim together with all the possible and topologically different isofrequency contours supported by eq.([disp2 ] ) whose associated five different regimes are : ( b ) hyperbolic - like i , ( c ) hyperbolic - like ii , ( d ) mixed , ( e ) elliptic - like i and ( f ) elliptic - like ii . it is remarkable that the class of shim metamaterials is able to support such a variety of regimes comprising both bounded ( e and f ) and unbounded ( b , c and d ) propagating wave spectra whose isofrequency contours \n can both be connected ( e ) and disconnected ( b , c , d and f ) . the mixed regime of fig.[five - regimes](d ) \n is characterized by an isofrequency contour showing elliptic - like and hyperbolic - like components @xcite . \n the elliptic - like ii regime of fig.[five - regimes](f ) has never been predicted , to the best of our knowledge , in one - dimensional metamaterials and it is main remarkable feature is that , within the allowed @xmath56 spectral region , there are two forward tm propagating waves with the same transverse momentum , i.e. additional waves occur .    in order to check the accuracy of the shim effective response of eqs.([response ] ) we compare its predictions with the full electromagnetic theory , both analytical ( bloch analysis of 1d photonic crystals ) and numerical ( 2d full - wave simulation @xcite ) . as a benchmark example to discuss the shim feasibility , \n we consider a periodically stratified structure whose unit cell comprises three homogeneous slabs , two of which ( @xmath57,@xmath58 ) represent the inclusion and the third ( @xmath59 ) describes the background . \n we consider a situation where the period to wavelength ratio is @xmath60 and we choose @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 with filling fractions @xmath64 and @xmath65 . \n such a material design meets the shim requirements since @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . \n the situation belongs to the elliptic - like ii regime of fig.[five - regimes](f ) where additional waves are expected as sketched in fig.[comparison](a ) . for this particular shim , we have numerically evaluated @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 from eqs.([par_eff ] ) . in fig.[comparison](b ) , we compare the isofrequency contour from eqs.([disp2 ] ) with the standard transfer matrix approach which provides the quasi - momentum @xmath73 of the bloch modes . \n the agreement of the above discussed shim response with full electromagnetic theory is particularly evident together with the occurrence of additional waves . \n note also that @xmath74 and @xmath75^{-1 } = -1 $ ] so that the standard effective medium theory predicts that plane waves propagation is forbidden in the considered medium , in striking contrast with the common result of our shim theory and of full electromagnetic analysis . \n it is worth stressing that such spatial dispersion dominated regime is achieved by means of relatively small values of the layers permittivities as compared to those pertaining high index inclusion metamaterials @xcite . due to the relevance and the novelty of such regime \n , we have analyzed through full wave simulations the excitation of the additional waves inside a slab of thickness @xmath76 @xmath77 m and filled by the above considered shim with period @xmath78 @xmath77 m . the slab is illuminated by a monochromatic plane wave with wavelength @xmath79 @xmath77 m and normally impinging onto the facet @xmath80 , as sketched in fig.[comparison](a ) . in fig.[comparison](c ) , we plot @xmath81 along the slab thickness and its profile reveals the occurrence of different spatial harmonics . in fig.[comparison](d ) we report the modulus of the fourier spectrum of @xmath81 which displays four distinct peaks corresponding to two forward and two backward propagating waves thus proving the possibility to excite additional waves in finite - thick slab . for completeness , in fig.[comparison](b ) we have superimposed to the above isofrequency contours the four waves numbers @xmath82 ( circles ) which coincide with those predicted by the above description of an unbounded shim .     to @xmath83 . \n shim dispersion at the vacuum wavelength @xmath84 shows a wave - vector degeneracy at @xmath85 and an associated dirac point . \n , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the existence of various different dispersion regimes implies that shims also host unusual topological transitions . as an example we consider a three - layer structure whose \n layers are filled with silver ag ( 1 playing the role of the inclusion ) , silicon oxide sio@xmath86 ( 2 ) and air ( 3 ) , with filling fractions @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . \n we have modelled the ag dielectric response with the drude permittivity @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 , @xmath92 s@xmath93 , \n @xmath94 s@xmath93 @xcite ) , and we have assumed for the sio@xmath86 permittivity @xmath95 an empirical sellmeier equation @xcite . \n we have evaluated the isofrequency contours for various vacuum wavelength both using the above shim response and the bloch theory and compared them with the isofrequency contours obtained from the standard homogenization theory of layered media @xcite . in fig.[transitions ] we plot @xmath96 and @xmath97 as functions of @xmath56 ( real ) at the three wavelengths @xmath98 . \n the agreement between shim and bloch theory is remarkable at any wavelength whereas the standard theory is not adequate since it reproduces a portion around @xmath54 of a single connected component of the correct isofrequency contours . at @xmath99 \n the shim is in the hyperbolic - like i regime since the lower and upper branches of figs.[transitions](a ) and ( b ) are of pure dissipative origin . on the other hand at @xmath83 ( figs.[transitions](e ) and ( f ) ) , \n the shim is in the mixed regime and this proves that a topological transition between the two regimes . \n it is remarkable that the such transition is accompanied by an intermediate state at @xmath84 ( see figs.[transitions](c ) and ( d ) ) where the two dispersion branches of the mixed regime merge at @xmath54 thus producing a wave - vector degeneracy and an associated dirac point .    in conclusion \n , we have introduced a class of 1d metamaterials ( shims ) supporting a peculiar electrodynamic behavior driven by optical nonlocalities . in comparison with other spatial dispersion enhancement strategies , since the inclusion permittivity is slightly high ( as defined above ) , our method for tailoring the shim response is not severely hampered by the lack of materials with very high dielectric permittivity . \n the shim structure triggers a novel physical mechanism boosting at the same time both electromagnetic chirality and second order nonlocality to the point of achieving their competition , in striking contrast to essentially all the other situation hitherto investigated . \n the dominant role played by spatial dispersion in shim leads to a variety of different electromagnetic regimes supporting exotic phenomena such as topological phase transitions an transverse magnetic additional waves . due to the their feasibility and to the variety of topologically different regimes \n they host , we believe that shims and their extension to higher dimensional structures could play a pivotal role for conceiving a novel class of metamaterials and radiation steering devices where optical nonlocality is fully exploited even in the optical range .",

    "output": "We studied the “chemical fingerprints” of eleven bright red stars that were ripped away from a small galaxy called Sagittarius. By matching starlight collected with a large telescope to computer-made rainbows, we measured how much carbon, oxygen, titanium, and iron each star contains. The stars sit at two points along a long stellar stream stretching behind Sagittarius like a tail. Along this tail the stars get noticeably poorer in metals (heavier elements) the farther they are from the galaxy’s core—much like finding older, rustier cans the farther you walk from a campsite. Because the break-up happened only recently, the tail still carries the original metal pattern of its parent galaxy, showing that gas inside the small galaxy barely stirred around. The mix of titanium and oxygen relative to iron is unlike that of our Milky Way’s halo, so similar shredded dwarf galaxies can’t have supplied most of the halo’s later, metal-rich stars."

assisted quantum transport , using an engineered network of laser - written waveguides , with relative energies and inter - waveguide couplings tailored to yield the desired hamiltonian . \n controllable decoherence is simulated via broadening the bandwidth of the input illumination , yielding a significant increase in transport efficiency relative to the narrowband case . \n we show integrated optics to be suitable for simulating specific target hamiltonians as well as open quantum systems with controllable loss and decoherence . \n recent research into photosynthetic antenna complexes has shown evidence of coherence in excitonic energy transport  @xcite , despite the noisy cellular environment in which such complexes are found . \n indeed , environmental decoherence has been credited with increasing the efficiency of transport through these systems , an effect known as environment - assisted quantum transport ( enaqt )  @xcite or dephasing - assisted transport  @xcite . while enaqt has been the subject of many theoretical studies  whether in the photosynthetic context  @xcite or in other nanoscale transport systems  @xcite  and despite its potential for improving transport in artificial quantum systems , it has so far never been directly observed . \n we use an integrated photonic simulator to demonstrate the first implementation of enaqt . \n our simulator was fabricated using femtosecond - laser direct writing , which allows waveguides to be drawn directly into glass using a focused pulsed laser . \n this permits the creation of three - dimensional waveguide arrays , as well as precision and repeatability in engineering interactions  @xcite . \n we used control over the wavelength and bandwidth of the guided light to simulate effective decoherence , thereby enhancing transport efficiency . \n we consider a single excitation on a network of @xmath0 coupled sites , governed by a tight - binding hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the excitation being localised at site @xmath3 , @xmath4 the energy of that site , and @xmath5 the coupling between sites @xmath3 and @xmath6 . \n although enaqt can occur on an ordered lattice where all the energies @xmath4 are equal  @xcite , transport enhancement was first explained in disordered systems , which we consider here . \n we are interested in the efficiency of transport from a particular initial site to a particular target site , where the excitation is trapped . in the case of a photosynthetic complex ( figure  [ fig : enaqt]a ) \n , trapping describes the transfer of excitons to a reaction center , where they drive charge separation . \n it can be modelled as irreversible coupling of the target site to a sink at rate @xmath7 ( figure  [ fig : enaqt]b ) . \n the efficiency is then the probability of finding the exciton in the sink after some particular time . \n enaqt occurs when decoherence increases the trapping probability over the fully coherent case . \n decoherence results from coupling of a quantum system to inaccessible degrees of freedom . \n for example , in photosynthetic antenna complexes , the energies of chromophores are coupled to molecular vibrations ; tracing out this environment results in decoherence in the excitonic subspace .    in the absence of decoherence \n , energetic disorder tends to localise the wavepacket through processes such as destructive interference or anderson localisation  @xcite , thus preventing it from reaching the target . \n since these are coherent processes , they are diminished by decoherence , possibly resulting in enhancement of transport efficiency to the target site . \n an alternative but ultimately equivalent view of enaqt is that eigenstates of @xmath8 are stationary , making it difficult to reach the target if the initial and target sites differ in energy . \n incoherent processes , however , permit transitions between the eigenstates of @xmath8 , yielding greater mobility .    the first theoretical explorations of enaqt focused on the case where the decoherence takes the form of site - independent , markovian , pure dephasing  @xcite . \n although the decoherence in our simulation is neither site - based nor markovian , this is not an obstacle to enaqt ;  @xcite transport efficiency can be enhanced as long as the decoherence allows population transfer between otherwise - stationary eigenstates . \n we simulate enaqt in an array of coupled single - mode optical waveguides obeying the equation  @xcite @xmath9 where the light is propagating in the @xmath10-direction , @xmath11 is a creation operator for a photon in waveguide @xmath3 at position @xmath10 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively the propagation constants of the waveguides and the couplings between them . \n the former are determined by the waveguides refractive index profiles , while the latter also depend on the separations between them . \n light propagation governed by this schrdinger - like equation directly simulates evolution under @xmath8 , with @xmath13 replacing @xmath5 and the @xmath12 replacing @xmath4 . \n we can thus simulate different hamiltonians by controlling the number , position , and refractive indices of the waveguides . \n the intrinsic stability of laser - written waveguide arrays renders decoherence challenging to simulate . \n one approach is to stochastically modulate the index of refraction along each waveguide  @xcite . \n though every realization with a particular longitudinal index profile will be fully coherent , decoherence can be simulated by averaging over the recorded optical outputs from many realizations in post - processing . \n this approach was recently used to simulate decoherence - enhanced navigation of a maze  @xcite .    by contrast , we simulate decoherence by averaging over the results from a single array illuminated with many optical wavelengths . \n although each individual wavelength propagates through the waveguide array coherently , decoherence can be achieved using broadband illumination and a single output intensity measurement which does not resolve wavelength . in other words , the wavelength degree of freedom \n is traced out yielding a partially mixed state . \n similar approaches are well established in optics , where for instance thick birefringent quartz plates followed by wavelength - insensitive measurements have been used to decohere the polarization states of single photons  @xcite .        as an example of our approach to simulating decoherence \n , we consider two uncoupled waveguides @xmath14 and @xmath15 that have a difference @xmath16 in their propagation constants at a wavelength @xmath17 . as light propagates along the waveguides \n , it will accumulate a phase difference @xmath18 between them . \n broadband illumination can then be seen to cause effective decoherence on a length scale comparable to the illumination coherence length : any initial coherence @xmath19 between the waveguides will decay : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the normalised first - order temporal correlation function of the light , which  being proportional to the fourier transform of the spectrum \n decays to zero faster for spectrally broader illumination . \n the strength @xmath22 of the decoherence can be quantified as the inverse of the optical coherence length , @xmath23 , and is usually proportional to the fwhm bandwidth @xmath24 . for a uniform distribution centered at @xmath17 , @xmath25    in the case of coupled waveguides \n , wavelength dependence affects couplings in addition to the propagation constants . \n the resulting decoherence will therefore not only have characteristics of pure dephasing ( as in equation  ) , but will also include off - diagonal terms . \n however , this kind of decoherence can also result in enaqt . \n indeed , the off - diagonal terms imply that our decoherence could , in principle , be used to simulate enaqt in ordered systems  @xcite , but the effect would be weaker because of the absence of the pure - dephasing contribution .    for our simulation we chose a network of four waveguide sites  arranged as in figure  [ fig : enaqt]c  because it is one of the smallest systems in which enaqt is possible and because it can give significant enhancements even with relatively weak decoherence . \n waveguide 1 was the input , waveguide 3 the target , and the sink consisted of a long linear array of tightly coupled waveguides . \n the coupling between waveguides in this sink was significantly higher than between the four main waveguides , so that any light entering the sink from waveguide 3 was largely transported away  @xcite . \n the sink need only be long enough to prevent light reflected from the far end from returning into the main simulation waveguides . \n we need to choose propagation constants and separations among the four main waveguides in order to best approximate this hamiltonian : @xmath26 where all parameters depend on the wavelength @xmath27 of the input light . due to their wide separations , \n couplings between non - neighbouring sites are negligible ( @xmath28 of neighbouring - site couplings ) . \n our simulator is designed so that , at our central simulation wavelength @xmath17 , @xmath29 in this case , one of the eigenstates of @xmath8 has no support on site 3 , @xmath30 , while the remaining three eigenstates all have substantial support on site 3 . \n because @xmath31 can not couple to the sink  at least at @xmath17the maximum trapping efficiency at infinite time is @xmath32 .    considering the wavelength dependence of @xmath8 \n provides a different way to see the decohering effects of broadband illumination . due to \n the dependence of @xmath33 and @xmath34 on the wavelength , equation   only holds at a particular wavelength @xmath17 . at other wavelengths \n , @xmath31 will have some support on waveguide 3 and thus be able to couple to the sink , increasing the efficiency above @xmath35 , as shown in figure  [ fig : enaqt]d . \n unlike in other examples of enaqt  @xcite , the efficiency increases monotonically with the strength of decoherence , meaning there is no optimal level of decoherence in this model .    based on measurements of couplings and propagation constants in isolated pairs of waveguides ( see methods ) \n , we selected the following design parameters : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ( see figure  [ fig : enaqt]c ) . figure  [ fig : setup]a shows numerical modelling of light propagation given these parameters . although these were designed for a center wavelength of 800  nm , variations in the implementation of the waveguide parameters resulted in equation  [ eqn : condition ] being satisfied at @xmath39  nm .    we measured the efficiency using narrowband light ( less than 1  nm bandwidth and always horizontally polarised for consistency ) from a tuneable ti : sapphire laser ( spectra - physics tsunami ) in quasi - cw mode ( figure  [ fig : setup]b ) . \n the output was imaged using a custom - built @xmath40 magnifying telescope and the optical power was measured using a large - area power - meter after isolating either the system or sink waveguides using a variable slit . \n examples of the output distribution are given in figure  [ fig : setup]c , showing the significant difference between illumination at @xmath17 and an off - center wavelength . \n figure  [ fig : results]a shows the measured efficiency ( fraction of light output in the sink modes ) for wavelengths ranging from 745 to 835  nm . \n enaqt  shown in figure  [ fig : results]b  is the average enhancement in efficiency over the spectral band of interest , relative to the efficiency at @xmath17 , @xmath41 where the average @xmath42 over @xmath27 is taken over the top - hat distribution on @xmath43 . as predicted \n , it is an increasing function of the bandwidth , i.e. , of the decoherence strength @xmath22 . \n the highest enaqt observed was @xmath44 at a bandwidth of @xmath45  nm . \n we thus demonstrated that coherent transport in a coupled , statically disordered system can be enhanced through decoherence .    the theoretical prediction in figure  [ fig : results]b contains no free parameters . it is a simulation of the dynamics under the simulated hamiltonian @xmath8 , together with trapping from site 3 at the rate @xmath7 discussed in methods and pure dephasing between waveguide @xmath46 and the other three waveguides at rate @xmath22 . \n the disagreement between theory and experiment is small considering the number of possible contributing factors . \n these include the off - diagonal decoherence when the waveguides are coupled , the fact that the trapping is not perfectly exponential , errors in the measurements of the coupling constants , optical losses , and error in satisfying equation  [ eqn : condition ] . as an example , the shaded band in figure  [ fig : results]b represents the error that would arise if @xmath47 deviated from @xmath48 by up to 10% .    in our experiment , \n the magnitude of enaqt was limited by the maximum achievable decoherence , which at @xmath49  @xmath50 was small compared to the inverse of the propagation length . \n we were limited by two components of equation : the tunability of our laser limited @xmath24 , while @xmath51 was limited ( via equation ) by the need to keep @xmath34 small enough to stay in the tight - binding approximation . \n these are not fundamental limitations , and future improvements that increase @xmath22 would result in significantly larger transport enhancement ; as shown in figure  [ fig : enaqt]d , the transport efficiency of this model can get arbitrarily close to 1 for sufficiently long propagation distances and decoherence strengths . \n stronger decoherence would also allow enaqt to be observed in networks that are less sensitive to decoherence than our model . \n our results demonstrate that integrated photonics are well - suited for simulating open quantum systems , capable of implementing a disordered target hamiltonian with controllable loss . \n the technique of using broadband excitation to introduce tuneable levels of decoherence ensures that photonics can simulate open quantum systems ; previously , low intrinsic noise in photonic devices rendered decoherence difficult to realize in integrated optics , particularly without averaging over results from many different device realizations . \n our approach will not only improve the controllability of photonic quantum simulation , but also aid in the experimental optimisation of transport in other engineered quantum systems .",
    "output": "Tiny particles can get stuck when they move through messy, random paths—like trying to walk blindfolded across a bumpy field. Scientists had guessed that a bit of noise (think gentle wind) could actually help the particles keep going instead of trapping them. Until now, no one had seen this “noise helps” idea in the lab.\n\nWe built a miniature racetrack: four hair-thin light channels laser-drawn inside glass. A single color of laser light entered one channel; our “target” was to reach the far end of another channel. When we widened the laser’s color range—adding controlled noise—more light made it to the target. The wider the color spread, the bigger the boost.\n\nThis first clear demo shows that carefully tuned disorder plus noise can speed up energy flow, a trick plants may already use in photosynthesis and one we can now copy for better quantum devices."

\n there are several studies in the literature which may lead to critical nodes for graphs by carrying morse theory to discrete settings . \n nevertheless , none of them gives a satisfied answer to the question . in computational geometry \n one may embed the graph into a 2d - surface and then apply morse theory for 2-manifolds @xcite . \n however , such a surface embedding is not natural for general graphs in biological and social networks . \n another candidate is discrete morse theory @xcite , which studies functions defined on all faces of cell complexes and is therefore hard to use in the graph setting above . \n a related subject is the extension of the poincare - hopf theorem to the graph setting , e.g. in @xcite . in this paper \n we present a purely combinatorial approach which starts from a discrete gradient flow induced by the function on graph nodes . \n such an approach does not need a surface embedding , and turns out to be closely related to persistent homology in computational topology @xcite and discrete morse theory @xcite without studying functions on high dimensional cells . \n in particular , given a function ( often referred to as an energy function ) on a network , we will define a discrete gradient flow associated with that function , as well as minimum energy paths between two disjoint sets of nodes . \n this allows us to define critical nodes or saddles . roughly speaking , critical nodes \n are associated with minimum energy paths between node pairs : index-@xmath2 critical nodes are simply local minima ; index-@xmath3 critical nodes are the highest energy transition nodes of minimal energy paths connecting index-@xmath4 critical nodes . \n such a critical node analysis , as we show by examples in social networks and biological networks , leads to a concise representation of networks while preserving some important structural properties . in short \n , the local minima or maxima together with their attraction basins can be interpreted as communities or groups in networks ; saddle points act as transition states between different critical points of lower indices . in particular , in social networks index-1 saddles act as hubs in connecting communities ; in biomolecular dynamics , index-1 saddles play roles as intermediate or transition states connecting misfolded and native states . in the latter , \n such an analysis does not rely on commonly used markov state model , whence can be applied to much more general data analysis . \n moreover , this approach leads to a hierarchical classification of nodes in the network and a global visualization of networks adaptive to the landscape of given energy function .    in algorithmic aspect , critical nodes in this paper \n can be computed at a polynomial time cost with an algorithm based on computational topology by monitoring topological changes over energy evel sets , and in nondegenerate case an almost linear algorithm exists which is scalable for the analysis of large scale networks .",

    "input": "we present a comprehensive study , using both analytical and numerical methods , of measurement - induced localization of relational degrees of freedom . looking first at the interference of two optical modes , we find that the localization of the relative phase can be as good for mixed states  in particular for two initially poissonian or thermal states  as for the well - known case of two fock states . in a realistic setup \n the localization for mixed states is robust and experimentally accessible , and we discuss applications to superselection rules . for an ideal setup and initial fock states \n we show how a relational schrdinger cat state emerges , and investigate circumstances under which such a state is destroyed . in our second example \n we consider the localization of relative atomic phase between two bose einstein condensates , looking particularly at the build up of spatial interference patterns , an area which has attracted much attention since the work of javanainen and yoo . \n we show that the relative phase localizes much faster than was intimated in previous studies focusing on the emerging interference pattern itself . finally , we explore the localization of relative spatial parameters discussed in recent work by rau , dunningham and burnett . \n we retain their models of indistinguishable scattering but make different assumptions . \n in particular we consider the case of a real distant observer monitoring light scattering off two particles , who records events only from a narrow field of view . \n the localization is only partial regardless of the number of observations . \n this paper contributes to the wider debate on relationism in quantum mechanics , which treats fundamental concepts  reference frames and conservation laws  from a fully quantum and operational perspective .",
    "output": "Imagine two flashlights shining light; even if their beams start random, simply watching which spots appear on a distant screen “locks” their relative timing—even for mixed states, not just perfect beams.  \nSame with Bose-Einstein condensates: counting atoms in overlapping clouds pins down their relative phase faster than older studies suggested.  \nFinally, a spy with a narrow camera lens watching light scatter off two tiny beads will only partly learn their separation; the beads’ relative position stays fuzzy no matter how many photos taken.  \n\nThese examples show how measurement itself sharpens relational info, not the objects. It matters because it shows how big-picture rules—reference frames, conservation laws—emerge from quantum interactions, not fixed rules."

    "output": "Imagine a flashlight beam crossing the universe. Where the light dims, a cloud of cold hydrogen has blocked it. By measuring how much light is lost, we can learn the cloud’s temperature, size, and chemical makeup.\n\nWe studied six such clouds that lived when the universe was about half its current age, filling a 4-billion-year gap where almost no data existed. Each cloud’s hydrogen temperature (its “spin temperature”) was paired with its heavy-element content (metallicity).\n\nLower-metallicity clouds are warmer and fluffier; richer clouds carry colder, denser pockets. Across all clouds, metal content and temperature slide in opposite directions: more metals, less warmth. One cloud is the coldest yet recorded.\n\nLinking these traits helps us see how distant galaxies stock their interstellar gas and shows what raw material future stars will recycle."

    "output": "Imagine stirring a cup of coffee: the spoon feels resistance from the swirling liquid. Engineers call this resistance “drag.” We wanted to see if adding tiny bubbles—like the fizz in soda—could make the spoon feel less resistance.  \n\nWhen the bubbles sit still, they only slightly thin and thicken the coffee, trimming drag by a few percent at most. But when the bubbles wiggle, they act like miniature trampolines, bouncing pressure waves around. This extra motion can slice drag far more than the bubbles’ mere presence alone.  \n\nIn short, shaking the bubbles matters more than just adding them. This finding gives ship and pipeline designers a simpler lever: by gently vibrating bubbly streams, we may one day help giant tankers glide more smoothly and fuel pipes pump more efficiently."

We listened to the whispers of nearby oxygen atoms (using a technique similar to hospital MRI) to learn how these compass needles talk to each other. In the flat “ab” plane they all cheerfully point the same way, like fans doing the wave in a stadium, and this teamwork survives even when the material is heated to 700 K. But if you look straight up or down the “c” axis, neighbors prefer to point opposite ways, like alternating red and blue arrows in a traffic lane; this neat alternation starts to wobble once the temperature climbs past about 550 K. Knowing exactly when and how these atomic compasses switch their coordination helps engineers design better spin-based electronics and understand how heat can flip magnetic patterns."

This slowdown always lines up with the liquid’s own flip-flop, no matter how many bearings we add.

When the clusters hold five or more atoms, the magnets inside start to point in opposite directions; this “ferrimagnetic” order then stays the most stable arrangement as the cluster keeps growing.  \n\nBecause the clusters stay electrical insulators across the whole size range, they could one day serve as building blocks for ultra-small magnetic memory bits or sensors."

The stiffer the skin, the less it stretches.  \n\nWe tried different recipes for the filling and varied the balloon size and wall thickness. Every test pointed to the same answer: the skin’s stiffness tops out near that of a rubber band.

Because the star is gassy and squishy, its equator usually spins a hair faster than its poles—an effect called differential rotation. One easy way to spot this speed difference is to line-up two “maps” of the freckles taken a few days apart and slide one until the patterns match; the tiny shift tells you the speed gap. But a single match-up can be fooled if big spots suddenly appear or vanish.\n\nA second trick bakes the speed difference right into the map-making step, yet that can also be tricked by shapes like a polar cap or an equatorial belt. \n\nWe offer a simpler fix: stack many match-ups from a long movie of maps and let the real, steady speed signal rise above the noise. Tests on fake star movies show the method keeps its cool. By giving us a cleaner read of how stars twirl at different latitudes, the tool helps trace how magnetic fields and winds inside stars shape their lives—something even a first-year student can picture the next time they watch the night sky."

magnetic field @xmath64 , latexmath:[$|\\psi_k^{\\pm } \\rangle \\equiv e^{-\\frac{i}{2}{\\mathbf h}^{\\pm}_k\\cdot\\hat{\\boldsymbol \\sigma}_k t }    @xmath6 state . \n thus , the electron spin coherence is measured by the divergence of the pseudospin paths , @xmath66 . \n @xmath67 is the geometric distance between the two conjugate pseudospin paths on bloch sphere . \n now we examine the consequences of the pseudospin echo . \n a fast @xmath68-pulse applied at @xmath69 to flip the electron spin @xcite would cause the pseudo - spin evolution @xmath70 to find out how to control the decoherence , we neglect for the time being the diagonal nuclear spin interaction @xmath53 , which contributes to the same component of the pseudo - magnetic field as @xmath71 but much smaller . because the pseudo - fields dominated by the extrinsic nuclear spin interaction , @xmath72 , invert exactly into each other , disentanglement of the electron spin from the affected bath spin pairs follows at @xmath73 as in the classic spin echo to remove the inhomogeneous broadening effect . \n the pseudo - fields dominated by the intrinsic interaction , @xmath74 , do not exactly invert under the influence of the electron spin flip and the resultant pseudospin trajectories are illustrated in fig . \n [ fig1](a ) . \n disentanglement from the affected nuclear pairs and , hence , recovery of the electron spin coherence occurs , by the rotation kinematics , at time @xmath75 , distinct from the classic echo . \n fig . \n [ fig1](b , c ) give the computed results for the electron spin coherence in a dot of @xmath76 nuclear spins in gaas which reveals the coherence recovery after a flip of the electron spin at a range of values for @xmath77 , even after the coherence has apparently vanished . \n furthermore , the coherence may be restored by a sequence of electron spin flips . \n for example , with a sequence of @xmath68-pulses evenly spaced with interval @xmath77 , the disentanglement from the bath will occur at @xmath78 between the @xmath31th and the @xmath79th pulses , as illustrated in fig . \n [ fig1](d ) . consider the correction from the small term @xmath53 in the pseudo - fields , the residue decoherence , at the disentanglement point @xmath80 , is measured by @xmath81 . \n compared to the free - induction decay @xcite where @xmath82 , the decoherence is reduced by a factor of @xmath83 ( @xmath84 for @xmath85s ) . \n ensemble average over the mixed bath states is necessary in two scenarios , namely , observation of decoherence of an ensemble of quantum objects and observation of a single quantum object repeated in a time sequence  @xcite . \n the coherence of the electron spin is now @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the inhomogeneous broadening factor due to the probability distribution @xmath33 of the initial bath state @xmath34 ( different nuclear bath state may result in different overhauser energy - splitting @xmath88 of the electron ) @xcite . \n @xmath89 $ ] under the control of a sequence of @xmath68-rotations on electron spin at @xmath90 and @xmath91 . \n the coherence factor @xmath92 is insensitive , up to a factor of @xmath93 , to the selection of initial bath state @xmath94 ( verified by numerical evaluations ) , and is taken out of the summation @xcite . \n both the inhomogeneous broadening and the pure decoherence due to the extrinsic bath spin interaction are shown to be removed at the classic spin echo time @xmath95 in contrast to the unusual recovery time of @xmath96 in the case of intrinsic bath spin interaction . \n we need a pulse sequence to produce a time where the decoherence from all three sources can be removed . \n a solution is a two - pulse control . \n fig . \n [ fig2](a ) shows that , after a second electron spin flip at @xmath97 , the paths of the two pseudospin states corresponding to the electron @xmath18 states driven by the intrinsic nuclear spin pair interaction cross again at @xmath98 , coinciding with the secondary spin echo time for the other two causes . \n this two pulse sequence is well - known as carr - purcell sequence in nmr spectroscopies @xcite . \n the residual decoherence at @xmath99 is @xmath100 . \n the restoration by two - pulse control of coherence in the presence of both pure and ensemble decoherence is demonstrated by the results of numerical evaluation shown in fig . \n [ fig2](b , c ) . \n the electron spin coherence is restored at @xmath101 by the second pulse even when the first spin - echo at @xmath95 has completely vanished , illustrating the remarkable observation @xcite that the absence of spin echo does not mean irreversible loss of coherence . \n the power of concatenation of pulse sequences has been shown in the context of dynamical decoupling in quantum computation @xcite . \n similarly , the control of disentanglement of the bath states from the quantum object may be enhanced by concatenation . the pseudo - spin evolution with the two - pulse control of the quantum object \n can be constructed recursively from the free - induction evolution @xmath102 , by the concatenation , @xmath103 , @xmath104 . \n the process can be extended by iteration , fig . \n [ fig2](d ) , to any level , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the rotation vector along the axis of rotation through an angle @xmath107 . \n disentanglement occurs at @xmath108 coinciding with the classic spin echo . for small @xmath107 , \n the recursion relation is @xmath109 . at each iteration , \n the rotation vectors of the conjugate pseudo - spin states have their mean @xmath110 increased by a factor of @xmath111 and their difference @xmath112 reduced by a factor of @xmath113 ( deduced by induction from @xmath114 ) . \n the decoherence is reduced by an order of @xmath115 at @xmath116 for each additional level of concatenation till saturation at the level @xmath117 . \n hence , the coherence echo magnitude scales with the echo delay time according to @xmath118 as shown in fig . \n [ fig2](e ) . \n our result shows the protection of electron spin coherence by pulse sequences with interpulse interval up to @xmath119s    in conclusion , we note that our scheme of restoring the coherence depends on the pure decoherence being driven by the interaction in the spin bath and by the domination of the bath pair excitation in the slow bath dynamics . \n the pulse sequence design is borrowed from the dynamical decoupling schemes in nmr spectroscopies @xcite and in quantum computation @xcite but the disentanglement method aims directly at the bath dynamics . \n our method seeks not to eliminate the object - bath interaction by dynamical averaging , but to disentangle by controlling the quantum object to maneuver the bath evolution . \n thus , elimination of coupling between the quantum object and the bath is not a necessary condition for their disentanglement , as illustrated by coherence recovery at @xmath120 where effective object - bath interaction does not vanish even in the first order of hyperfine coupling @xmath121 . \n direct observation of coherence echoes at such magic times is possible with the narrowing of inhomogeneous distribution by measurement projection @xcite . \n the control of bath spins may well develop into a valuable addition to the collection of armaments of coherence preservation for quantum information processing . \n we acknowledge support from nsf dmr-0403465 , aro / lps , and darpa / afosr .    26    natexlab#1#1bibnamefont # 1#1bibfnamefont # 1#1citenamefont # 1#1url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2]#2 [ 2][]#2    , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , _ _ ( , , ) , ed .    , * * , ( ) .    , \n * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) \n ; , * * , ( ) ; , , , * * , ( ) .    , _ _ ( , , ) .    , , , * * , ( ) .    , _ _ ( , , ) , ed .    , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , * * , ( ) .    , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , ( ) .    , , , , , \n * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , * * , ( ) . \n the orbital wavefunction of the electron covers all @xmath0 nuclei , so the contact hyperfine coupling with each nuclear spin is @xmath121 , inverse proportional to the bath size @xmath0 .    , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , * * , ( ) .    , , , , , , , , , , , \n * * , ( ) .    , , , * * , ( ) . \n , , , , , ( ) ; , , , * * , ( ) ; , , , , * * , ( ) . \n * supplementary information for `` restoring coherence lost to a slow interacting mesoscopic bath '' *",

density - parity - check ( ldpc ) @xcite and turbo @xcite codes . \n these codes are special , not only because they can approach the virtually error - free transmission limit , but mainly because a computationally efficient iterative decoding scheme is readily available . when operating at moderate noise values these approximate decoding algorithms show an unprecedented ability to correct errors , a remarkable feature that has attracted a lot of attention @xcite . \n however , it was also shown that the approximate algorithms are incapable of matching the performance of maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding beyond the so - called error - floor threshold found at higher signal - to - noise - ratios ( snr ) . \n the importance of error - floor , i.e. highest snr , analysis was recognized in the early stages of the turbo code revolution @xcite , and it soon became apparent that ldpc codes are also not immune to the error - floor deficiency @xcite . to estimate the error - floor asymptotics in modern high - quality systems is a notoriously difficult task because direct numerical methods , e.g.  monte carlo , can not be used to determine bit -

initio by construction , i.e.  the optimization scheme required no additional assumptions ( e.g.  no sampling ) . \n this numerical optimization scheme , called the instanton - amoeba scheme , which plays a central role in our analysis , was shown to be accurate at producing configurations whose validity , for actual optimal noise configurations , can be verified theoretically . finally , the instanton - amoeba scheme , introduced in @xcite , is also generic , in that there are no restrictions related to the type of decoding or the channel .    to illustrate the last , most important point , we complement the analysis of @xcite that focused on the white gaussian symmetric channel , by using the new results for the white laplacian channel explained in this manuscript . \n our choice of the laplacian channel is arbitrary , e.g. influenced by its relevance to the description of fiber -

This study looks at the fast-moving particles (pions and other hadrons) that spray out after the crash. By tracking how many of these particles reach the detectors, we can tell if the soup slowed them down. The team found that the soup does indeed slam the brakes on the fastest particles, and the amount of slowing is the same for gold-on-gold and copper-on-copper crashes once the particles are moving faster than about 5 times the momentum of a thrown baseball. This energy-loss pattern matches what simple “speed-bump” models predict. Finally, the relative numbers of different particle types stay fixed across three collision types, suggesting that the particles are simply shrapnel from ordinary jets of matter.

    "output": "We zoomed in on a narrow sky ribbon—think of it as a cosmic hallway—and took tiny rainbow-like fingerprints (spectra) of hundreds of galaxies. Inside that hallway we caught six hyper-bright cores called Seyfert galaxies; they’re like fireflies hiding inside streetlamps, glowing far brighter than the cities around them. We also compared Hubble photos taken seven years apart and spotted several cores that flickered, proving they’re active even though they’re dimmer than any seen from Earth-based telescopes. Because our space-eye view is so sharp, we can find these shy, lightweight “engines” farther back in time than before. Mapping them shows how small black holes grow and shape their host galaxies, filling a gap in the story of how today’s universe came to look the way it does."

plastic depinning transition and jamming transition for these three classes of systems . like standard phase transitions , \n these dynamical transitions are associated with diverging length scales quantifying the degree of cooperativity in the flow or in the deformation response . amongst the consequences \n , experiments have shown that the rheology of granular materials and emulsions is non - local : the stress at a given location does not depend only on the local strain rate but also on the degree of mobility in the surrounding region @xcite . \n non - local constitutive relations were recently proposed and successfully tested against numerical and experimental results @xcite . \n as these relations are derived from a gradient expansion in the order parameter , analogous to a ginzburg -

locality . \n ( i ) for hard non - deformable grains , the topological analysis of the contact network provides a state parameter , the mean contact number @xmath8 , to distinguish between solid - like and liquid - like states . \n close to the jamming transition , flow is only possible along floppy modes , by essence spread in space and prescribing the cooperative motion of the particles @xcite . \n the evolution of the contact network results from the rapid formation of force chains followed by a slow zig - zag instability of these structures @xcite . \n ( ii ) for very elastic particles e.g. for foams , emulsions or glassy lennard jones phases , the dynamics in the quasi - static regime is controlled by elasto - plastic events  @xcite : when sheared , energy is slowly stored and rapidly released through scale - free avalanches , in close analogy with the depinning transition of an elastic line . \n recent experiments have suggested that an assembly of rigid particles could similarly present an intermittent succession of plastic events localized in space and time @xcite . \n ( iii ) the third picture is based on an analogy with eyring s transition state theory for the viscosity of liquids @xcite , where mechanical fluctuations would play the role of temperature in thermal systems . \n each plastic rearrangement is assumed to generate at random a new realization of the forces on the contact network , allowing for the formation of new weak zones where the next rearrangement will occur . in this letter \n , we will test successively these three pictures using discrete element simulations .    _ \n the numerical system _ is a 2d shear flow , similar to that used in  @xcite , and composed of grains confined between two rough solid walls . by means of gravity - like vertical forces \n , the normal stress @xmath9 is increased gradually in two thin boundary layers located close to the walls ( fig . \n [ fig1]a ) and reaches a constant value @xmath10 in the bulk ( fig . \n [ fig1]b ) . \n the yield parameter @xmath11 based on the shear stress @xmath0 , which is kept homogeneous across the cell , and on the dynamical friction coefficient @xmath12 is the central control parameter ( fig . \n [ fig1]b ) . in order to emphasize non - local effects , we focus here on the case @xmath13 , were the grains flow _ below the yield stress _ under the influence of the distant shear zone . \n _ _ the jamming framework  _ _ provides a picture of non - locality essentially based on the contact network geometry . \n the central criterion to render the status of a packing of hard grains is the mean contact number per grain @xmath8 . \n following maxwell rigidity criterion , we define the distance @xmath14 to isostaticity as the difference between the number of constrains and the number of degrees of freedom ( the number of force components ) . \n one must distinguish the case were a coulomb friction between the particles , of coefficient @xmath15 , is introduced from the frictionless case ( @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 were @xmath18 is the space dimension and @xmath19 the fraction of sliding contacts @xcite . \n a system is  solid  , i.e. rigid , when hyperstatic ( @xmath20 ) and  liquid  when hypostatic ( @xmath21 ) . \n importantly , this criterion is entirely non - local because it is global , which means that liquid or solid regions can hardly be isolated .    in our numerical system , \n @xmath8 and @xmath14 are defined as eulerian fields , by averaging over realizations or , equivalently , as we work with simulations in a statistically steady state , over time . in fig . \n [ fig1]c and fig .  [ fig1]d , we display profiles of @xmath14 , both in the frictional and frictionless cases . \n we first notice that all values are positive . \n these profiles can be fitted to a shape of the form @xmath22 . \n this means that @xmath14 spatially relaxes toward @xmath23 from both walls , in an exponential manner . \n the whole system ( the boundary layers and the bulk ) constitutes a single continuous liquid phase . from the jamming perspective , the flow in the bulk , observed when the stress is lower than the yield stress , results from a lack of coordination in the contact network . \n particles are expected to move cooperatively along floppy modes whose characteristic size diverges at the jamming point . \n a flowing region therefore favors the motion around it . \n as it affects the contact network geometry in its neighborhood , one expects the corresponding non - local correction to the rheology to remain finite in the limit of vanishing shear rate . \n since there is a relation between @xmath8 and the rescaled shear rate @xmath24  @xcite , this jamming picture is consistent with the non - local constitutive relation based on a gradient expansion in @xmath25 , derived , calibrated and tested in a previous letter @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the effective friction coefficient for homogeneous shear flows . \n the laplacian @xmath28 encodes the non - local effect , assumed isotropic ; it is rescaled by @xmath25 to form @xmath29 , which remains finite as @xmath30 . \n the linear expansion of the non - local correction is written as @xmath31 , with @xmath32 .    _ \n _ mechanical activation _ \n la eyring _  _ _ has recently been put forward in the interpretation of the experiments of reddy  _ et al _ @xcite . \n the conceptual idea of these authors was to measure the rheology within a shear band that is below the yield condition , but under the remote influence of a shear zone forced by rigid boundaries . as discussed below , \n an exponential behavior of the local shear rate with the distance to the yield condition has been interpreted as a boltzmann - like factor , with an effective ` temperature ' that would result from mechanical activation .    to investigate whether this behavior is consistent with the previous picture , we probe numerically the rheological response with a local micro - rheometer in the spirit of the set - up proposed by @xcite ( fig . \n [ fig2]a and @xcite ) . \n bulk horizontal forces acting on grains are added to impose a different shear stress in a small central region . \n fig . \n [ fig2]b shows the resulting profile of the yield parameter @xmath33 . as before , \n the flow is driven by the two boundary layers located close to the moving walls , which are above the yield condition . in the bulk \n , the flow is kept below the yield condition ( i.e. @xmath34 ) . \n the shear rate at the locations where @xmath33 crosses @xmath35 is noted @xmath36 and is considered as a boundary condition for the bulk rheology . \n the micro - rheometer is the central region where a different yield parameter @xmath37 is imposed . \n its thickness is noted @xmath38 and its location is @xmath39 away from the boundaries ( fig . \n [ fig2]a ) . \n the relation between the shear rate @xmath40 in the center of the micro - rheometer and the rescaled shear stress @xmath37 gives access to the local rheological properties . in practice , @xmath40 depends on four other parameters : @xmath36 , @xmath2 , @xmath39 and @xmath41 . in the experiments of @xcite , the micro - rheometer was a small rod immersed in a granular medium confined in a couette cell and submitted to an external force , which , once rescaled by its critical value , plays the role of @xmath37 . \n the rod creep velocity is the analogous of @xmath40 and the shear rate @xmath36 is the analogous of the rotation velocity of the inner cylinder . \n note that contrarily to the numerical set - up , the radial profile of the yield parameter @xmath33 is not homogeneous in the couette cell . \n the key observations reported in @xcite are recovered in the numerics . \n ( i ) the shear rate @xmath40 in the micro - rheometer is proportional to the shear rate @xmath36 imposed by the boundary ( fig . \n [ fig2]a ) . \n ( ii ) @xmath40 ( roughly ) decreases exponentially with the distance to the yield condition , measured by @xmath42 ( fig . \n [ fig2]b ) . \n this exponential dependence can be recovered by the non - local rheology : linearizing the constitutive relation ( [ rheononlocali ] ) around the critical state ( @xmath43 ) , the inertial number @xmath25 decays exponentially over a relaxation length @xmath44 @xcite . using the continuity of @xmath25 and @xmath45 at the interface @xmath46 \n , it is straightforward to integrate eq . \n [ rheononlocali ] @xcite . in the limit @xmath47 , \n the solution reads : @xmath48 \\!. \\qquad \\label{gammadots}\\ ] ] this solution is displayed in ( fig . \n [ fig2 ] ) and is in excellent agreement with the numerical simulation results , without any adjustable parameter , once the constitutive relation ( [ rheononlocali ] ) has been calibrated in the simple shear case . in particular , the two key properties ( i ) and ( ii ) are recovered . in conclusion , \n the exponential behaviors found either experimentally  @xcite or in the present simulations result from a linear relaxation of the shear rate . \n they do not point to a specific mechanism like mechanical activation , but to any mechanism that , like jamming , is roughly isotropic and leads to a finite non - local correction at vanishing shear rate .     as a function of the yield parameter @xmath37 in the micro - rheometer . \n ( a ) evidence for linearity of the response to the shear rate in the boundary layers @xmath36 .

local nature of the granular rheology \n , we compared the dynamics of two otherwise identical systems composed of hard and soft grains . \n the presence of localized plastic events is usually based on a visual inspection of different fields . \n the squared deviation from an affine deformation on a local scale has for instance been proposed as a field indicating plastic activity @xcite . \n however , such a quantity , as well as all those based on the non - affine velocity field , characterize fluctuations around the mean flow , and not the local contribution of a certain area to the mean flow . \n we wish here to propose a practical definition of these events , based on the quantitative criterion that they must be separated in time and localized in space . \n importantly , to match their role played in elasto - plastic models @xcite , they must also contribute additively to the average shear rate @xmath51 .    in order to detect localized plastic events , \n we have built a coarse - grained field @xmath57 reflecting , at time @xmath58 , the local contribution to @xmath51 of a small region around the position @xmath59 . \n we impose that the time average of @xmath60 must everywhere give @xmath51 . \n a coarse - graining method similar to that proposed for the stress tensor @xcite is adapted here to the computation of velocity differences \n see @xcite for the explicit expression of @xmath60 . \n we display in fig . \n [ fig4 ] for a system of rigid ( a ) and soft grains ( b ) , spatio - temporal diagrams showing the local contribution @xmath60 to the shear rate @xmath51 , measured on the central line of the cell ( without micro - rheometer , i.e. in the system schematized in fig . \n [ fig1]a ) . \n we observe contrasted behaviors in the two cases . in the soft system , \n nothing much happens most of the time , except for short periods of intense activity , associated with a cascade of plastic events . \n conversely , the hard system presents more moderate but permanent fluctuations even for asymptotically small @xmath51 .    to make these observations quantitative , fig . \n [ fig4]c shows the probability distribution function ( pdf ) over time of @xmath61 , which is the space average of @xmath60 over the cell . in panel \n ( c ) , we similarly display the pdf of the spatial standard deviation @xmath55 . \n the hard - particle system presents a narrow gaussian distribution of @xmath61 around @xmath51 , while the pdf corresponding to the soft system shows stretched tails , which are due to a very intermittent behavior associated with these plastic events ( fig . \n [ fig4]c ) . \n the pdf of @xmath55 provides informations about spatial heterogeneities in the system . \n the peak of the black line around @xmath62 in fig . \n [ fig4]d indicates that they are large and permanent in the hard system . for the soft system \n , the pdf shows an algebraic decay , which means that the field @xmath51 is homogeneous most of the time . \n however , when the computation of @xmath55 is restricted to the periods of time where plastic events occur ( periods where @xmath63 is larger than @xmath64 in fig . \n [ fig4]d ) , its pdf also presents a peak : in the soft system , plastic events are associated with a very heterogeneous field of @xmath60 . in conclusion , \n an assembly of rigid particles does not present local plastic events when sheared permanently . \n its dynamics is not intermittent but presents spatial heterogeneities . \n _ conclusion _    the study reported in this letter allows us to conclude that the non - locality in dense granular flows of rigid particles is consistent with the existence of floppy modes characterizing the jamming picture . \n the most striking observation is the lack of localized plastic events in such _ liquid _ flows . \n this seems to be in contradiction with the fact that plastic events have been observed experimentally in both soft @xcite and hard @xcite particle systems . \n however , from the jamming point of view , all these systems are _ solid _ : foams and emulsions present plastic events when they flow at high volume fraction ; a granular sample that is not prepared in the critical state by shearing is generically hyper - static , due to friction . \n this suggests that @xmath14 ( or the volume fraction ) could be the parameter controlling the cross - over between a non - local behavior ruled by the contact network geometry and another controlled by local plastic events . \n further numerical studies are required to investigate the nature of this cross - over . \n moreover , we have shown that the non - local constitutive relation proposed by bouzid et al . \n @xcite is able , without any other adjusting parameter or any assumption on the mechanisms at work , to predict the inhomogeneous fields stemming from a micro - rheological response . \n this results gives further incentive to clarify the relation between the constitutive coefficients and the most fundamental aspects of the soft - modes dynamics in the vicinity of the jamming transition . \n ba is supported by institut universitaire de france . \n this work is funded by the anr jamvibe and a cnes grant .    * *    supplementary material",
    "output": "Imagine a sandcastle that can suddenly start to ooze if you push one side.  \nWe built tiny “sand” piles on a computer and gently sheared a narrow strip at the edge. Even grains far from that strip felt the push and began to creep.  \n\nWe asked: how does the news travel?  \nThree stories were proposed:  \n1. Random mini-collapses act like microscopic earthquakes.  \n2. The grains shuffle like people in a crowded bus, each tiny move nudging neighbors.  \n3. The whole pile teeters on the edge of “jamming,” so any motion must spread through loose paths that snake across the sample.  \n\nBy watching every grain, we found no sharp quakes or random nudges—just smooth, spreading motion that fades away like ripples on a pond.

    "output": "Imagine a lunch-box-sized “ghost catcher” parked right beside a running nuclear reactor. DANSS is exactly that: a lightweight block of safe plastic that glows whenever an antimatter twin of the neutrino—called an antineutrino—crashes into it. By sitting so close, it records about 15 000 of these faint flashes each day, enough light to watch the reactor’s power rise or fall just like checking a car’s speedometer. Because the block is divided into tiny pixels, unwanted fake signals are cut to one in a hundred, making the measurement clean. A mini-version has already proved the idea works under a real 3 GW plant. The whole detector can slide back and forth on rails, letting scientists vary the distance to the core and test if any neutrinos briefly vanish into a “sterile” ghost state. A year of data should reveal whether these short disappearances happen, sharpening our picture of matter’s most elusive particles and offering a new way to keep tabs on nuclear fuel without opening the reactor."

gaussian noise : random telegraph noise with lorentzian spectrum and colored noise with @xmath0 spectrum . \n we analyze in details the estimation precision achievable by quantum probes and prove that population measurement on the qubit is optimal for noise estimation in both cases . \n we also evaluate the optimal interaction times for the quantum probe , i.e. the values maximizing the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) and the quantum signal - to - noise ratio . for random telegraph noise \n the qfi is inversely proportional to the square of the switching rate , meaning that the quantum signal - to - noise ratio is constant and thus the switching rate may be uniformly estimated with the same precision in its whole range of variation . for colored noise , \n the precision achievable in the estimation of `` color '' , i.e. of the exponent @xmath1 , strongly depends on the structure of the environment , i.e. on the number of fluctuators describing the classical environment . \n for an environment modeled by a single random fluctuator estimation is more precise for pink noise , i.e. for @xmath2 , whereas by increasing the number of fluctuators , the quantum signal - to - noise ratio has two local maxima , with the largest one drifting towards @xmath3 , i.e. brown noise . \n in any communication channel or measurement scheme , the interaction of the information carriers with the external environment introduces noise in the system , thus degrading the overall performances . the precise characterization of the noise is thus a crucial ingredient for the design of high - precision measurements and reliable communication protocols . in many physical situations , \n the main source of noise is associated to the fluctuations of bistable quantities . in these cases , \n a suitable description of the noise is given in terms of classical stochastic processes @xcite . \n in particular , in the case of phase damping , i.e. pure dephasing , it has been shown that the interaction of a quantum system with a quantum bath can be written in terms of a random unitary evolution driven by a classical stochastic process @xcite . \n the characterization of classical noise is often performed by collecting a series of measurements to estimate the autocorrelation function and the spectral properties @xcite . \n this procedure is generally time consuming and may require the control of a complex system . \n a question thus arises on whether more effective techniques may be developed . to this purpose \n , we address the use of _ quantum probes _ to estimate the parameters of classical noise . \n we assume to have a quantum system interacting with the classical fluctuating field generating the noise and explore the performances of quantum measurements performed at a fixed interaction time to extract information about the classical noise . \n the power and implications of this idea are undeniable : the features of a complex system may be determined by monitoring a small probe , which is usually characterized by few and easily controllable degrees of freedom . \n the simplest and paradigmatic example of this situation is that of a qubit interacting with a noisy environment . \n after a given interaction time , which may be suitably optimized , quantum - limited measurements on the qubit may be used to characterize the environment , e.g. to estimate the parameters describing its noise spectrum .    in this paper \n we focus on the characterization of two classes of classical noise : random telegraph noise ( rtn ) with lorentzian spectrum and the power - law @xmath0 _ colored _ spectra arising from the interaction with a collection of random bistable fluctuators . \n both rtn and colored noise are examples of classical non - gaussian noise occurring in several system of interest . \n indeed , the microscopic models underlying these kinds of noise have been extensively analyzed in the literature @xcite . \n the relevant parameters characterizing this kinds of noise are the switching rate of the rtn and the exponent @xmath1 in the case of power - law spectra . \n both quantities do not correspond to observables in a strict sense and therefore we have to resort to indirect measurements performed on the quantum probe to infer their value . in order to optimize this inference procedure \n we employ tools from local quantum estimation theory @xcite , which have already been proved useful in the estimation of static noise parameters @xcite and in several other scenarios , as for example the estimation of quantum correlations @xcite , gaussian states @xcite , optical phase @xcite , critical systems @xcite and quantum thermometry @xcite . \n in particular , we will optimize the initial preparation of the qubit and the interaction time in order to maximize the quantum fisher information and the quantum signal - to - noise ratio . \n furthermore , we show that population measurement provides optimal inference for both the noise models . \n this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec1 ] we introduce the physical dephasing model employed throughout the paper and describe the main features of rtn and colored noise . in section [ sec2 ] \n we briefly review the main tools of quantum estimation theory , whereas in section [ sec3 ] we present our results on the precision achievable by quantum probes in the estimation of the spectral properties of noisy random environments . \n section [ sec4 ] closes the paper with concluding remarks .",

Instead of tracking every tiny star, we drop “sink beads” wherever gas piles up enough to collapse, giving us a direct count of how much mass is ready to become stars.\n\nOur simple recipe—just gravity and a steady gas pressure—matches two key facts astronomers see: the tight link between gas density and star-making speed, and the sharp cutoff below which star birth stops. The big takeaway: gravity, not fireworks from newborn stars, sets the pace of star formation; feedback acts more like a thermostat, keeping the gas pressure steady. Understanding this helps explain why galaxies turn gas into stars at the rates they do."

Some scientists said the traffic count of these cars sets a strict speed limit for nearly invisible bikes called neutrinos that travel with them. Other researchers checked the math and found the speed limit is only tight in one narrow lane; everywhere else the limit is set by the glow of gamma-ray headlights, letting bikes go roughly 100 times faster.\n\nWe rewrote the traffic rules in plain words and asked: which road conditions make each limit hold? When we average over all known blazars—galactic lighthouses—those lighthouses are murky enough to trap the fastest cars, so the neutrino bikes can still whiz along without breaking the cosmic-ray count. The gamma glow, not the cosmic-ray traffic, is the real bottleneck.\n\nBottom line: current predictions for spotting these neutrinos in IceCube and other detectors stay unchanged; no extra tweaks are needed."

We let each drum talk to a cloud of trillions of atomic nuclei, which act like a very long-lived memory stick: they can catch the drum’s quantum message and pass it along later.  \n\nNext, we shine a weak microwave “flashlight” on the setup. Normally the light would be blocked, but because the drum-nuclei team can share energy, the light slips through—an effect called electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). With enough nuclei, we see two dark “windows” instead of one, meaning the light is slowed twice.  \n\nWhy care?

    "input": "dna condensation by multivalent cations plays a crucial role in genome packaging in viruses and sperm heads , and has been extensively studied using single - molecule experimental methods . in those experiments , the values of the critical condensation forces have been used to estimate the amplitude of the attractive dna - dna interactions . here , to describe these experiments \n , we developed an analytical model and a rigid body langevin dynamics assay to investigate the behavior of a polymer with self - interactions , in the presence of a traction force applied at its extremities . \n we model self - interactions using a pairwise attractive potential , thereby treating the counterions implicitly . \n the analytical model allows to accurately predict the equilibrium structures of toroidal and rod - like condensed structures , and the dependence of the critical condensation force on the dna length . \n we find that the critical condensation force depends strongly on the length of the dna , and finite - size effects are important for molecules of length up to 10@xmath0 . \n our langevin dynamics simulations show that the force - extension behavior of the rod - like structures is very different from the toroidal ones , so that their presence in experiments should be easily detectable . in double - stranded dna condensation experiments , \n the signature of the presence of rod - like structures was not unambiguously detected , suggesting that the polyamines used to condense dna may protect it from bending sharply as needed in the rod - like structures .",
    "output": "**Why this matters:**  \nPacking a long DNA chain into a tiny virus or sperm head is like stuffing a 30-metre garden hose into a shoebox. Cells rely on small positively charged “clips” (multivalent cations) that zip the DNA into tight loops or rods. Knowing how much pulling force is needed to keep the loops closed tells us how strong the clips are.\n\n**What we did:**  \nWe built a simple toy-model: a self-sticking necklace pulled from both ends. Analytical math and computer simulations show two stable shapes—**donuts** and **straight rods**—and predict the exact pulling force needed to open them. Short necklaces (up to 10 µm) need noticeably stronger pulls, a size effect missed by earlier work.\n\n**Key finding:**  \nRods and donuts respond differently to tug-of-force, so spotting rods should be easy. Yet past experiments saw only donuts, hinting that the natural “clips” (polyamines) may shield DNA from sharp bends required for rod formation."

consequently , such reactions probe the short range dynamics of the baryon - baryon system . as a consequence , \n meson - exchange calculations at such large momentum transfers are in general not dominated by the single pion - exchange : for a quantitative description , the exchange of all mesons with masses up to typically 1 gev , i.e. , the exchange of the goldstone bosons @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , of the vector mesons @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and of the @xmath12-dominated scalar mesons @xmath13 and @xmath14 have to be included explicitly @xcite . \n as the relative phases and the form factors of the corresponding meson-@xmath0 vertices are in general unknown , even in the cleanest single - meson production reaction , such as the near - threshold @xmath7 and @xmath15 production , which are dominated , respectively , by the excitation of the @xmath3(1535 ) and @xmath3(1650 ) resonances @xcite , the model predictions depend sensitively on the _ ad hoc _ interplay between the various meson exchanges @xcite . \n examples for near - threshold @xmath7-production show a characteristic uncertainty up to one order of magnitude in exploring the relative phases between the different mesons@xcite . an additional , equally drastic uncertainty is the highly unknown behavior of the different meson - baryon transition vertices if continued far off - shell into the space - like region . \n + of course , there are prescriptions in the literature , specifying both diagonal and non - diagonal mesonic nucleon couplings to baryon resonances with arbitrary spins and positive or negative parity , and the relative phases between different meson - induced transition vertices @xcite . for the transition to negative parity , \n spin 1/2 , baryon resonances , which we investigate in this note , i.e. for @xmath16 @xmath17 vertices ( @xmath18 denotes scalar , pseudo - scalar or vector mesons ) , the standard recipe is to start from the @xmath19 vertices - which are expected to be well understood from experimental evidence , such as from nn scattering at low energies @xcite - and add for the transition vertices the negative parity operator @xmath20 , yielding a well defined scheme for the relative mesonic couplings ( of course , the strength of various vertices on and off shell remains completely open ) . \n already at first inspection such a procedure may be ambiguous depending on the explicit order of implementation relative to the dirac matrices in the @xmath19 vertices ( while , for example , the extension of the pseudo - scalar ( ps ) @xmath21 vertex to @xmath22 is unambiguous , however , a sign ambiguity may already arise for the pv vertex from @xmath23 ( the absolute coupling constants are related by the equivalence theorem for the baryons on their mass shell @xcite ) ; similarly on the su(3 ) level mesonic vertices involve d and f components , implying different phases for the @xmath16 vertices @xcite . \n + in this note we would like to investigate these questions , i. e. the relative phases of the different meson exchanges and the structure of the meson - nn@xmath24 transition form factors in a quark - diquark model for the baryons . in the following chapter \n we derive the corresponding formalism ;

the most extensive investigations for the coupling to non strange baryon resonances were obtained from a self - consistent coupled channel approach to hadron and/or @xmath26-induced meson production on the nucleon @xcite or from a detailed analysis within the non relativistic constituent quark model @xcite . however \n , opposite to the last reference , it seems questionable to fix in a fairly model independent way the vertices @xmath25 , which still involve an overall arbitrary phase for the various resonances ; only the coupling to a given resonance is well defined with respect to the phases in @xmath19 , which are fairly well known . \n thus we focus here on a specific resonance , the @xmath27 and investigate the relative phases of selected @xmath16 couplings and the t - channel continuation of the coupling constants ( the same conclusions hold for the @xmath28 resonance ) . as we aim to apply our findings in a next step to meson exchange models at high momentum transfers up to 1 gev / c \n , our emphasis is to estimate form factors for the off - shell continuation in a ( at least approximately ) covariant , but still economical way . for this end \n , we compromise on our quark representation of the interacting hadrons : we represent baryons as quark - diquark objects @xcite , keeping in this work only the scalar - isoscalar component . for our purpose \n such an approximation seems well justified : different investigations show a strong dominance of the scalar component for the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon up to ( and beyond ) momentum transfers of 1 gev / c ; in the same momentum range axial diquarks renormalize magnetic form factors , having , however , no significant influence on their momentum spectrum @xcite ) . \n as the form factors derived show a smooth momentum spectrum ( see the discussion below ) , minor modifications of axial diquarks are readily taken into account in a slight renormalized range parameter for the quark - diquark wave function . \n in addition , as a main advantage , lorentz boosts are easily incorporated in a purely scalar diquark picture ( the incorporation of lorentz boosts is still matter of discussion in the literature @xcite ) . \n the mesons we still treat as elementary objects , which couple directly to the q - ( qq ) system ( one may include a phenomenological form factor to simulate their finite extension ) . \n we expect that our treatment of the meson fields is qualitatively acceptable , as we do not aim at absolute predictions of @xmath16 parameters , but develop simple scaling rules for the n@xmath24 vertices , by exploring their structure relative to the ground - state baryon , i.e. , the nucleon . for the baryons , the quark - diquark representation allows to incorporate approximate covariance beyond non - relativistic potential models , being able to include lorentz - quenching in the radial wave function and the modification of the small component , which enters explicitly into the leading non - relativistic reduction of the vertices . \n explicitly we work within harmonic confinement , yielding for the @xmath2 and the @xmath29 resonances , which are assumed to be pure p - shell excitations of a single quark@xcite ,    @xmath3000 > _ c\\ ] ]    and @xmath31 1/2,\\mu^*>_s|\\ ! 1/2 , 1/2>_t \\!|\\ !

with respect to practical applications in mind , i.e. , near threshold meson production with the @xmath3 produced practically in rest in the ( by far ) dominant post - emission amplitude@xcite , we drop here minor corrections from lorentz quenching for the resonance and the nucleon in the final state . \n clearly more sophisticated representations for the @xmath44 as 3q objects found in the literature , they , however , focus either on baryon spectroscopy @xcite or only on a very selective decay channel ( i. e. the @xmath7 channel , @xcite ) . as in addition , extensions to include @xmath45 admixtures in baryons as the leading component in a systematic fock expansion , which clearly are of significant importance for baryons in the continuum , as well as a more detailed and systematic baryon - spectroscopy in a quark - diquark representation are currently missing , we have to defer the investigation of these aspects to future work . + * ii.2 . \n phases of the @xmath25 vertices * + with these ingredients we formulate our problem explicitly . \n starting point are the relativistic @xmath19 vertex functions with their well defined phase structure for : for @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 mesons they are given explicitly by @xcite : + - @xmath19 : the covariant forms    @xmath49    yield in the leading non - relativistic limit    @xmath50    for a nucleon with @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( at threshold ) in initial and final state , respectively , and with @xmath53 . \n above we followed the standard notation from bjorken - drell @xcite ( we represented the vector fields by the polarization vector @xmath54 with @xmath55 ) and keep for the transition to the @xmath3 the leading @xmath56-dependence in the vector coupling ) . from above we formulate with the recipe    @xmath57    the vertex functions involving the ( @xmath58 ) baryon resonances , yielding for the + - @xmath16 vertices in the covariant form    @xmath59    with the static limits :    @xmath60    ( above we dropped the corresponding tensor term for the @xmath16 vertex , as there is no evidence for a large anomalous magnetic moment of the @xmath3(1535 ) or the @xmath3(1650 ) ) . \n + for the investigation of the @xmath16 vertices in the quark - diquark model \n we first establish the relative signs of the @xmath19 and @xmath16 vertices , and supplement the findings in a second step in a more detailed derivation of the corresponding @xmath2 and @xmath3 transition form factors . \n + we derive the vertex structure explicitly in momentum space : from the general structure    @xmath61    in @xmath32-space , where @xmath62 refers to the operators in eqs.(5,8 ) , we obtain with the corresponding fourier transforms    @xmath63    together with    @xmath64    and upon evaluating the @xmath65 integration via the @xmath14-function , the representation    @xmath66    for an arbitrary @xmath67 . + upon normalizing the momentum space wave functions \n appropriately we find for the @xmath2 with external longitudinal momentum @xmath68 ( as reflected in the coefficient @xmath69 from eq . \n ( 3 ) ) and the @xmath3 in rest from the coordinate space representations in eqs . \n ( 1,2 )    @xmath701/2\\mu^*>\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath71    ( where , for a practical comparison with @xmath16 vertices as obtained by the @xmath20 substitution above , we keep the complex unit @xmath72 in the @xmath3 normalization constant ) . \n + we establish the relative signs of the @xmath16 vertices in the limit of small or vanishing momentum transfer q ;

the momentum dependence in the fall off reflects only the moderately different baryon size parameters ( note that we still keep the meson as point - like objects ) . \n the influence of lorentz - quenching is significant : it enhances the ratio @xmath117 without quenching by typically a factor of 2 ; the effective size parameter varies from its value @xmath39 for a nucleon at rest to    @xmath118    for @xmath119 ( fig.(2.b ) ) . \n + a quantitatively different structure is found for the pseudo - scalar and the space - like vector - meson @xmath0 vertices ( fig.(5 ) ) : while exponentially they exhibit a similar , gaussian - dominated behavior such as the scalar and time - like vector form factors , their overall momentum spectrum is enhanced : the overlap of the p - wave in the @xmath3 with the pseudo scalar ( p - wave ) operator , adds a @xmath120 to the overlap integral of the form factors , which leads to a typical momentum dependence ( for @xmath121 )    @xmath122    of course , for a quantitative insight into the structure of the different form factors a more realistic calculation is necessary .    * \n iv . \n summary and outlook * + summarizing our brief report , we formulated the dominant meson-@xmath1 and meson-@xmath0 vertices in a simple quark - diquark model for baryons , together with the assumption of the coupling of mesons as elementary objects ( a philosophy which strongly resembles the spirit of the quark - coupling - models @xcite ) . \n we extract both the relative phases between the @xmath16 vertices ( for p - wave dominated @xmath123 resonances ) and the momentum spectra of the hadronic form factors for momenta up to 1 gev / c . for our findings \n we feel on a safe ground for the relative phases of the coupling constants , however , the hadronic form factors should be improved in the light of more sophisticated representations for @xmath124 resonances ( we remark , however , that in contrast to the merits of our simple two - body representation of baryons the resolution into 3 quarks immediately raises the well known problems of center - of - mass corrections and lorentz - quenching @xcite ) . \n we expect that with continuous and sophisticated data from hadron and electron factories a much more profound understanding of the nature of baryon resonances may be gained in the near future . \n + in this note we did not address a further serious problem for the relative phases of the various meson exchange : i.e. the coupling of the @xmath3 vertices to the meson - nucleon continuum above the pion threshold . \n we are presently investigating this aspect - which gives rise to complex form factors - in a simple perturbative model , hoping for a more consistent understanding of meson - baryon vertices and thus of the structure @xmath3 resonances high in the continuum of the nucleon@xcite . \n 2.0 cm    * appendix * + here we collect the different overlap integrals for the hadronic form factors . \n @xmath125    @xmath126    @xmath127    @xmath128    @xmath129    with    @xmath130    ( for the @xmath3 vertices @xmath131 has to be replaced by @xmath132 in @xmath133 ) . \n 99 t. walcher : nucl . phys . \n * a50 * ( 2005 ) 185 ;

    "output": "What is this study about, in plain words?\n\nImagine the proton as a tiny city of quarks. Sometimes the city gets “excited” and becomes a slightly bigger, short-lived version of itself (a baryon resonance). We want to know how these excited cities talk to lighter “messenger” particles called mesons (pions, kaons, rho’s, etc.).  \n\nThe catch: we don’t know the exact dialing rules—how strongly each meson calls, or whether the calls add or cancel. Without these rules, every theoretical guess for meson-production experiments can swing by a factor of ten.\n\nWe built the simplest workable model: treat the proton as one quark plus a little two-quark “dumb-bell” (a diquark), and let mesons couple to this pair. From this picture we derive:\n- the relative plus/minus signs (phases) of the couplings  \n- how the strength of each coupling fades when the meson is far off-shell (form-factors up to 1 GeV/c momentum)\n\nThe phases come out stable; the form-factors show a smooth drop-off, except for pseudo-scalar mesons where the P-wave overlap gives a small boost. Knowing both sets of numbers lets future experiments interpret their data without the old factor-of-ten fog, sharpening our picture of how the proton’s excited states are put together."

Because this theory is reliable at higher speeds, we can watch these branes collide like ultra-fast bumper cars—something the usual string picture can’t show clearly.\n\nWe checked two outcomes: the branes simply glancing away (elastic) and the branes destroying each other (annihilation). Annihilation always loses the race; glancing wins every time.\n\nWe also spot a signal that a brane and an anti-brane can briefly stick together, forming a loose “atom” made of two branes—think of an electron and a positron making positronium, but with sheets instead of particles.\n\nFinally, we work out the long-range “force law” between two branes and discover it cares about their orientation (polarization).

We can’t see the cloud, yet it outweighs the frisbee five-to-one.  The big puzzle: how much of the mass lives in the frisbee versus the cloud, and how do they shape each other?\n\nA few rare spiral galaxies act like natural magnifying glasses: their gravity bends the light of a more distant galaxy behind them.  By measuring both this bending (lensing) and the speed at which the frisbee’s stars orbit (rotation), we can tease apart the visible and invisible pieces—something ordinary pictures can’t do.\n\nIn this first paper we introduce SWELLS, a new set of 16 such cosmic magnifiers (plus a few maybes) snapped by Hubble and the Keck telescope.  The galaxies range from smooth, old “lenticulars” to messy, star-forming spirals, giving us a wide laboratory.  Because they follow the same size-and-weight trend as everyday edge-on spirals, they’re likely a fair sample of massive, tilted disks.\n\nBy studying them further, we’ll learn how efficiently these galaxies turn gas into stars, how strongly stars push gas around (feedback), and whether dark matter’s invisible scaffold gets reshaped by the bright stuff we can see."

    "output": "Imagine a neat stack of microscopic rods that line up like logs in a lumberyard and form tidy layers. We used computer experiments to watch how single rods wander through this stack. Because the layers act like gentle speed-bumps, the rods hop upward or downward far more slowly than they slide sideways inside one layer—think of hopping between slow-moving escalators while jogging freely on level ground. This sluggish hopping stretches over times that differ by ten-thousand-fold, and the motion becomes jumpier as the pile gets denser. Surprisingly, these perfectly calm, layered patterns behave much like rapidly cooled liquids that are still struggling to relax. Knowing how rods move inside such stacks helps explain how these materials flow or jam, guiding future design of displays or new self-assembling materials."

    "output": "Imagine a tiny Velcro patch on a protein that grabs another protein to pass a message inside the cell.  We studied one of these patches, called a PDZ domain, and asked: “What makes it let go?”\n\nInstead of tracking every atom, we ran simplified computer movies that keep only the essential shape.  Warming the patch to body temperature showed the Velcro doesn’t pop off in one click; the strands slowly drift apart as the “stickiness hill” they must climb shrinks.  This drift is so much slower than older textbook rules predicted that the release can take roughly 100× longer.\n\nWatching each contact break one by one revealed the exact un-sticking path.  Why care?  Many signaling and disease pathways depend on when PDZ domains grip or release their partners; knowing the timing helps us design better drugs or understand how cells talk."

    "output": "Imagine the nucleus of an atom as a tiny stadium where protons and neutrons pair up like dance partners. We built a simple scoreboard—an “algebraic shell model”—that predicts the moves these partners make.

Across many mid-size nuclei, the predicted playlist matches the real one, including the fine details. This gives us a clearer map of nuclear structure and helps physicists understand why some nuclei are stable while others fall apart."

parameter field . \n relative homotopy groups provide a useful tool for characterizing effects when the order - parameter manifold changes its character on a surface or when it is constrained by boundary conditions . \n relative homotopy groups can also be used to discuss properties of a defect that is itself regarded as a singularity in the order - parameter field in ordinary homotopy theory . \n finally , the relative homotopy group is useful to calculate the absolute homotopy group via the exact sequence of homomorphisms .    as an illustrative example , let us again consider a ferromagnetic bec . \n suppose that the system is contained in a cylinder of radius @xmath0 and impose a boundary condition that the spin points in the positive @xmath1-direction at @xmath2 and outward or downward on the wall at @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the radial coordinate . \n then , the spin texture would look like @xmath5 \\frac{e^{i\\varphi}}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\sin \\beta(r ) \\\\[1 mm ] e^{2i\\varphi } \\sin^2 \\frac{\\beta(r)}{2 } \\end{pmatrix}. \\label{m - h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because the direction of spin is @xmath6 , the above boundary conditions are met if we choose @xmath7 and @xmath8 or @xmath9 . \n the topological objects corresponding to @xmath8 and @xmath9 are referred to as the mermin - ho vortex and anderson - toulouse vortex , respectively . \n it can be shown that the circulation at the wall is 1 for the mermin - ho vortex and 2 for the anderson - toulouse vortex . \n they are good examples of relative homotopy because both of them are not stable in free space and they can be stabilized only if the boundary conditions on the wall are imposed by some means .    in general , the @xmath10th relative homotopy group @xmath11 consists of the elements of @xmath12 from which those of @xmath13 are subtracted . \n we consider an @xmath10-sphere in @xmath14 and let it expand into @xmath15 by continuous deformation . \n such an expansion may be regarded as a one - to - one mapping of @xmath13 into a subgroup of @xmath12 . \n let im@xmath16 be the image of this homomorphism . \n then , by the definition given above , the relative homotopy @xmath11 is a quotient group of @xmath17 in @xmath12 : @xmath18    the relative first homotopy group @xmath19 can cope with planar defects with nontrivial boundaries . \n a well - known example is a planar soliton ( maki domain wall ) in the a phase of superfluid helium-3 , where the order - parameter manifold is @xmath20 within a dipole healing length from the domain wall and @xmath21 outside this layer due to dipole locking . \n the domain wall may be regarded as a linear defect as seen from the edge of the wall . \n we take the axis perpendicular to the domain wall as the @xmath1-axis . \n then , the order - parameter field defines a mapping from the @xmath1-axis into the contour in @xmath15 whose end points belong to @xmath14 . because @xmath22 , such contours are also classified as @xmath23 , of which the nontrivial one corresponds to the maki domain wall . \n the relative second homotopy group @xmath19 allows the stabilization of a point object subject to a boundary condition on a sphere enclosing it . \n another example is the boojum  a point defect that appears in the a phase of superfluid helium-3 when it is contained in a hard - wall sphere . because @xmath24 , the bulk superfluid a phase does not support a topologically stable point defect . \n however , because the @xmath25 vector must be perpendicular to the surface , a point singularity for the @xmath25-vector appears on the surface that is connected to a nonsingular vortex texture in the bulk . \n the line defects are characterized by the first homotopy group ( or the fundamental group ) @xmath26 . for the case of _ \n s_-wave superconductors , liquid helium-4 , and spin - polarized or spinless gaseous becs , the order parameter is scalar and the order - parameter manifold is @xmath27 . \n the fundamental group is therefore the additive group of integers : @xmath28    for the case of a spin-1 bec , the ground state can be ferromagnetic or polar . \n the order - parameter manifold of the ferromagnetic phase is so(3 ) and the fundamental group is @xmath29 , the two - element group . \n the spin configuration that corresponds to class 0 is continuously transformable to a uniform configuration , whereas the spin configuration that corresponds to class 1 describes a singly quantized vortex that is topologically stable . because 1 + 1 = 0 in @xmath30 , the coalescence of two singly quantized vortices is homotopic to a uniform configuration . \n conversely , there is a configuration called the anderson - toulouse vortex that is nonsingular at the origin but has circulation of two away from the origin . \n next , let us consider the polar phase of a spin-1 bec . \n the order - parameter manifold is @xmath31/({\\mathbb z}_2)_{{\\bm f},\\phi}$ ] . as we have discussed in sec . \n [ sec : sym_opm ] , the @xmath32 symmetry arises from the fact that the order parameter given by eq . \n is invariant under the simultaneous transformation of @xmath33 . \n because @xmath34 is not simply connected , to calculate @xmath35 , we lift @xmath36 to @xmath37 and use eq .  . \n then , the points that are identical to @xmath38 in @xmath39 are @xmath40 for even @xmath10 and @xmath41 for odd @xmath10 , and those points constitute an additive group of integers @xmath10 . \n hence , we have @xmath42 as in the case of a scalar bec , vortices in the polar phase are classified by integers . \n however , due to the @xmath32 discrete symmetry , the minimum unit of circulation is one - half of the usual value of @xmath43 , as discussed in sec . \n [ sec : vortex_spin1polar ] .    in a similar manner \n , we may expect that the uniaxial , biaxial , and cyclic phases in spin-2 spinor becs can support various types of vortices due to the discrete symmetry , as discussed in sec . \n [ sec : vortices ] . \n some of them have fractional circulations , and some others have no mass circulation . \n the topological charge can be expressed algebraically as a functional of the order - parameter field . the topological charge corresponding to @xmath44 \n can be expressed as a line integral of the velocity field . \n point defects are characterized by the second homotopy group . because @xmath45 , scalar becs have no topologically stable point defects . \n when the order - parameter manifold is @xmath46 , it can host monopoles because @xmath47 .    here \n , we consider the situation shown in fig . \n [ fig : homotopy3 ] , where @xmath48 is a mapping from @xmath46 to @xmath46 . \n the topological charge @xmath49 of the point defect can be calculated as follows . by definition \n , @xmath49 gives the number of times the vector @xmath48 shown in fig . \n [ fig : homotopy3 ] wraps @xmath46 . expressing the components of this vector in spherical coordinate as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 \n , we can calculate @xmath49 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the spherical coordinates of @xmath57 , and the last term on the right - hand side is the jacobian of the transformation of the coordinates . \n the fact that the integrand is the jacobian explicitly indicates that @xmath49 gives the degree of mapping from @xmath46 in real space to @xmath46 in order - parameter space . the right - hand side of eq . \n ( [ n_2 ] ) can be directly expressed in terms of @xmath58 as @xmath59 where @xmath60 we can use gauss law to rewrite the right - hand side of eq . \n ( [ n_22 ] ) as a volume integral : @xmath61 where @xmath62 gives the density distribution of point singularities . + * t - hooft - polyakov monopole ( hedgehog ) *    next , we consider the polar phase . \n the second homotopy group is given by @xmath63 , and therefore , it can accommodate point defects . to investigate their nature , we write the order parameter in the following form : @xmath64 by setting @xmath65 , we obtain the spherical monopole called t - hooft - polyakov monopole or hedgehog : @xmath66 it follows from eq .   that the topological charge of the hedgehog is @xmath67 . \n moreover , @xmath68 defined in eq . \n is related to the circulation of spin currents given by eq .   as @xmath69 which implies that the surface integral of the spin circulation is quantized in terms of @xmath70 \n ; @xmath71 + * alice ring *    the monopole in the spin-1 polar phase is energetically unstable against deformation into an alice ring  @xcite . \n the alice ring is a combined object of two defects characterized by @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( see fig . \n [ fig : homotopy7 ] ) . \n viewed far from the origin , it appears to be a point defect ( @xmath67 ) ; however , along the ring @xmath74 on which the order parameter is singular , it appears to be a continuous distribution of line defects ( @xmath75 ) . \n this topological object is called the alice ring , and it has been predicted to be realized in an optically trapped spin-1 @xmath76na bec  @xcite . \n +    * dirac monopole *    the magnetic monopole was originally envisaged as a magnetic analogue of the quantized electric charge : @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the strength of the magnetic monopole . \n the solution of this equation is easily found to be @xmath79 and the corresponding vector potential is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 are the polar coordinates and @xmath82 is the unit vector in the @xmath83-direction . \n the vector potential ( [ vectora ] ) reproduces the magnetic field ( [ bfield ] ) , except on the positive @xmath1-axis along which the magnetic field exhibits a singularity called the dirac string : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the unit vector along the @xmath1-direction . \n the dirac monopole can be created in the ferromagnetic phase of a spin-1 bec  @xcite . \n substituting @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 in eq . \n ( [ eqscb88 ] ) , we obtain @xmath89 \\frac{e^{-i\\varphi}}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\sin\\theta \\\\[1 mm ]               \\sin^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2}. \\end{pmatrix } \\label{dirac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding superfluid velocity @xmath90 [ defined by eq .  ] \n is the same as the vector potential ( [ vectora ] ) of the dirac monopole with the identification @xmath91 . \n it is interesting to note that the order parameter ( [ dirac ] ) exhibits a doubly quantized vortex only along the positive @xmath1-axis . \n one can say that because the first homotopy group of so(3 ) is @xmath32 , which allows only a singly quantized vortex called a polar - core vortex as a stable topological object , the doubly quantized vortex must terminate at the magnetic monopole . \n in fact , the singular dirac monopole can deform continuously to a nonsingular spin texture if we take the following parametrization : @xmath92 \\frac{e^{-i\\varphi}}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\sin\\beta \\\\[1 mm ]               \\sin^2 \\frac{\\beta}{2 } \\end{pmatrix } , \\ \\ \n \\ \\beta(r,\\varphi , z)=\\theta ( 1-t)+\\pi t. \\label{dirac2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can see that as @xmath93 increases from 0 to 1 , the order parameter continuously changes from the dirac monopole at @xmath94 to a nonsingular texture @xmath95 at @xmath96 .      when two different types of topological objects coexist , there exists an action of one object on the other as they move relative to each other . as an example , consider a spin-1 polar phase in which two monopoles with charge 1 merge in the presence of a half - quantum vortex . \n as a monopole turns around the vortex , it changes sign . \n thus , if they merge along line 1 , the order - parameter field must deform , as shown in fig .  [ \n fig : homotopy9 ]  ( b ) , and the combined object has the topological charge of two . on the other hand , when they merge along line 2 , the order - parameter manifold can deform into the one shown in fig . \n [ fig : homotopy9 ]  ( c ) , and the topological charge is zero , indicating that the two monopoles annihilate in pairs . \n this example illustrates that the charge of the monopole changes its sign as it moves around the half - quantum vortex along curve 2 .      * \n shankar skyrmion *    the third homotopy group characterizes topological objects called skyrmions that extend over the entire three - dimensional space . \n a prime example of this is the so - called shankar monopole  @xcite , although it is actually not a monopole but a skyrmion . \n the topology of the shankar skyrmion is @xmath97 , which is supported by the ferromagnetic phase of a spin-1 bec . \n the order parameter of the ferromagnetic bec is characterized by the direction of the local spin @xmath98 and the superfluid phase that can be parametrized in terms of two unit vectors such as @xmath99 and @xmath100 that form a triad with @xmath101 : @xmath102 . \n concrete forms of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are introduced in sec . \n [ sec : vortex_spin1ferro ] .    the class one element of @xmath97 may be realized by rotating the triad at position @xmath57 about the direction  @xcite @xmath103 through an angle @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 . \n it follows from the last condition that the triad is uniform in spatial infinity , and thus , the three - dimensional space is compacted to @xmath107 . \n the case of @xmath108 is shown in fig . \n [ fig : homotopy8 ] . \n the topological charge of the third homotopy group can be introduced in a manner similar to that of the second homotopy group . \n now , the mapped vector has a four - component vector that is normalized to unity . \n one such representation is @xmath109 the invariant of such a mapping is again given by the jacobian of the transformations : @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the completely antisymmetric tensors of the third and fourth orders , respectively , and the roman letters run over @xmath113 and the greek letters run over @xmath114 . + * knot soliton *    the third homotopy group also classifies knot solitons . \n knots differ from other topological excitations such as vortices , monopoles , and shankar monopoles in that they are classified by a linking number while others are classified by winding numbers . \n knots are characterized by mappings from a three - dimensional sphere @xmath107 to @xmath46 . as in the case of shankar monopoles , \n the @xmath107 domain is prepared by imposing a boundary condition that the order parameter takes on the same value in every direction at spatial infinity . here , we consider the spin-1 polar phase  @xcite . \n the order parameter manifold of the polar phase is given by @xmath115 , of which neither @xmath116 nor @xmath32 symmetry contributes to the homotopy groups in spaces higher than one dimension ; hence , we find that @xmath117 . \n the associated integer topological charge @xmath118 is known as the hopf charge , and it is given by @xmath119 where @xmath120  @xcite . \n note that the domain ( @xmath57 ) is three - dimensional , while the target space ( @xmath121 ) is two - dimensional . \n consequently , the preimage of a point on the target @xmath46 constitutes a closed loop in @xmath107 , and the hopf charge is interpreted as the linking number of these loops : if the @xmath121 field has hopf charge @xmath118 , two loops corresponding to the preimages of any two distinct points on the target @xmath46 will be linked @xmath118 times [ see fig . \n [ fig : knot_preimage ] ( a ) ] . \n figure  [ fig : knot_preimage ] ( b ) shows an example of the @xmath121 field of a polar bec with hopf charge 1 ( b ) is an _ unknot _ of a pair of rings with linking number 1 , because the preimage of one point on @xmath46 forms a simple unknotted ring . ] . \n knots can be created by manipulating an external magnetic field . in the presence of an external magnetic field \n , the linear zeeman effect causes the larmor precession of @xmath121 , whereas @xmath121 tends to become parallel to the magnetic field because of the quadratic zeeman effect . \n suppose that we prepare an optically trapped bec in the @xmath122 state , i.e. , @xmath123 , by applying a uniform magnetic field in the @xmath1-direction . \n then , we suddenly turn off the uniform field and switch on a quadrupole field . because of the linear zeeman effect \n , @xmath121 starts rotating around the local magnetic field , and therefore , the @xmath121 field winds as a function of @xmath93 , resulting in the formation of knots . \n figure  [ fig : knottime ] shows the creation dynamics of knots in an optical trap subject to the quadrupole field , where the upper panels show the snapshots of the preimages of @xmath124 and @xmath125 and the bottom panels show cross sections of the density for @xmath126 ( bottom ) components on the @xmath127 plane . \n the density pattern in @xmath126 components is characteristic of knots ; a double - ring pattern appears corresponding to one knot . \n as the @xmath121 field winds in the dynamics , the number of rings increases . \n this prediction can be tested by the stern - gerlach experiment . \n topological objects are conjectured to play important roles in the formation of our universe . among them , knot solitons have recently attracted the interest of cosmologists since faddeev and niemi suggested that knots might exist as stable solitons in a three - dimensional classical field theory  @xcite .",

Tiny wiggles in the earliest light might also come from radioactive ashes flung to the surface of the exploding star.\n\nWhy care? Pinpointing when the explosion truly started helps us weigh the white-dwarf star that blew up and sharpen the “cosmic ruler” astronomers use to measure the universe."

Inside this fence the bump can still exist, but now it can also “rattle” at special gap frequencies and shake itself apart.  \n\nWe show there is a new, sturdy kind of bump that lives only inside these gaps, and we uncover the simple reason why some bumps start wobbling. Knowing this helps engineers design better light traps in tiny optical chips and new materials that steer signals without letting them leak away."

Physicists call this box-like universe “anti-de Sitter space.” Inside, light and matter move on straightest-possible paths called geodesics. If these paths suddenly stop or pinch off, a “singularity” forms—think of it as the universe’s GPS crashing.\n\nWe first check whether the famous Hawking-Penrose rules guarantee such a crash inside the mirrored box. They do, but only if a “closed trapped surface” (a spot where light itself gets stuck, like water swirling down a drain) already exists. New computer simulations show the box can still crash even without that drain, so researchers hoped to drop the trapped-surface rule. We tried two ways to remove it and hit roadblocks both times.\n\nIn the second half we focus on a simpler, round box filled with a perfect fluid. We prove that if the fluid moves fast enough, the drain-like surface must appear. Once it does, the old rules say a singularity is unavoidable.

    "input": "we present a comprehensive catalog of 700 confirmed star clusters in the field of m31 compiled from three major existing catalogs . \n we detect 418 and 257 star clusters in _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( @xmath0 ) near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) and far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) imaging , respectively . \n our final catalog includes photometry of star clusters in up to 16 passbands ranging from fuv to nir as well as ancillary information such as reddening , metallicity , and radial velocities . in particular , this is the most extensive and updated catalog of uv integrated photometry for m31 star clusters . \n ages and masses of star clusters are derived by fitting the multi - band photometry with model spectral energy distribution ( sed ) ; uv photometry enables more accurate age estimation of young clusters . \n our catalog includes 182 young clusters with ages less than 1  gyr . \n our estimated ages and masses of young clusters are in good agreement with previously determined values in the literature . the mean age and mass of young clusters \n are about 300  myr and 10@xmath1 , respectively . \n we found that the compiled [ fe / h ] values of young clusters included in our catalog are systematically lower ( by more than 1  dex ) than those from recent high - quality spectroscopic data and our sed fitting result . \n we confirm that most of the young clusters kinematics show systematic rotation around the minor axis and association with the thin disk of m31 . \n the young clusters distribution exhibits a distinct peak in the m31 disk around 10 - 12  kpc from the center and follow a spatial distributions similar to other tracers of disk structure such as ob stars , uv star - forming regions , and dust . \n some young clusters also show concentration around the ring splitting regions found in the southern part of the m31 disk and most of them have systematically younger ( @xmath2 100  myr ) ages . considering the kinematical properties and spatial distribution of young clusters \n , they might be associated with the well - known 10  kpc star - formation ring structure in the m31 disk . \n consequently , we suggest that various properties of young clusters in m31 might be in line with the scenarios that a satellite galaxy had passed through the disk of m31 less than few hundred million years ago .",
    "output": "We made the most complete list ever of star cities inside the Great Andromeda Galaxy. Picture 700 tiny villages (star clusters) whose ages and colors we measured with 16 different cameras, from ultraviolet to infrared. Most villages are old, but 182 are younger than 300 million years—mere toddlers on galactic timescales. These youngsters line up like pearls along a 10 000-light-year ring, spinning together with the galaxy’s thin disk. Their motion and layout match the scars left by a smaller galaxy that astronomers think sideswiped Andromeda a few hundred million years ago. By catching this cosmic hit-and-run in action, our atlas helps uncover how galaxies grow when they collide."

    "output": "Imagine you have a long grocery list of tiny probabilities that tell particle physicists how likely two particles are to scatter.  \nUntil now, the list was written in a clumsy foreign language called Mellin–Barnes integrals (think of them as messy, nested fractions).  \nWe built a free Mathematica tool named mbsums that automatically translates those fractions into simple, familiar sums—like turning a page of hieroglyphs into everyday arithmetic.  \n\nNo new formulas are invented; we just rewired the translator so computers can read the probabilities faster and without mistakes.  \nThe payoff: anyone with a laptop can now check or reuse these scattering recipes in minutes instead of days, making particle physics calculations quicker, cleaner, and less error-prone."

    "input": "we comment on zero- and low - temperature structural phase transitions , expecting that these comments might be relevant not only for this structural case . \n we first consider a textbook model whose classical version is the only model for which the landau theory of phase transitions and the concept of `` soft mode '' introduced by ginzburg are exact . within this model \n , we reveal the effects of quantum fluctuations and thermal ones at low temperatures . \n to do so , the knowledge of the dynamics of the model is needed . however , as already was emphasized by ginzburg _ \n et al . \n _ in eighties , a realistic theory for such a dynamics at high temperatures is lacking , what also seems to be the case in the low temperature regime . \n consequently , some theoretical conclusions turn out to be dependent on the assumptions on this dynamics . \n we illustrate this point with the low - temperature phase diagram , and discuss some unexpected shortcomings of the continuous medium approaches .",
    "output": "Imagine a material that changes its inner pattern when it gets cold, like water freezing into ice. We study this change at very low or even “absolute-zero” temperature, where tiny quantum jitters—not heat—rule.\n\nWe pick the simplest textbook model that teachers use to explain such “shape-shifting.” Surprisingly, it is the only one where two famous ideas—Landau’s picture of transitions and the “soft-mode” concept (think of a guitar string that goes slack before it snaps)—work perfectly.\n\nBy tracking how the model wiggles over time, we show how both quantum and slight-thermal wiggles alter the final pattern. But there is a hitch: nobody yet knows the correct wiggle rules at low temperatures, just as was true for high temperatures 40 years ago. Because we must guess those rules, our map of which pattern appears at which coldness can shift if we pick a different guess.\n\nThis matters: if basic assumptions change the answer, we need better experiments or theories before we can reliably design ultra-cold electronics or quantum materials."

    "input": "we study the effects of the finite size of the baryons on the equation of state of homogeneous hadronic matter with hyperons . \n the finite extension of hadrons is introduced in order to improve the perfomance of field theoretical models at very high densities , simulating the short - range hard - core repulsive part of the baryon - baryon potential . \n we choose the quark meson coupling model to describe the baryon dynamics because this model provides a density dependent radius of the bag . \n in addition we calculate finite size corrections for the zimanyi - moszkowski model in order to make a definite comparison . in both cases \n finite size effects are implemented through a van der waals like correction in the normalization of the baryon fields . in this approach \n we investigate @xmath0-stable matter in conditions that could be found in the interior of massive stars . \n we find that the excluded volume corrections contribute significantly for densities above twice the symmetric nuclear matter saturation density , although for the quark model the results strongly depends upon the equilibrium conditions for the confinement volume immersed in a dense medium . + \n pacs : 12.39.ba , 13.75.ev , 21.30.fe , 21.65.+f , 26.60.+c    -1 cm",
    "output": "Imagine squeezing a city bus into a shoebox: once the box is full, the bus itself takes up space you can’t use anymore.  \nInside neutron stars, particles called baryons behave the same way.  We treat each baryon as a tiny, solid marble instead of a point, then watch how the leftover “box” space changes the star’s squeezability.  Using two simple models, we add this “marble size” effect and find the star’s core can get noticeably stiffer once the squeeze exceeds twice the density of an atomic nucleus.  Knowing how crowded particles really are helps us understand how heavy a neutron star can become before it collapses."
